    "temperature": "Temperatures averaging 70°F/21°C - 80°F/26°C are very good and not much below 50°F/10°C",
    "light": "The A.Vera thrives on bright light conditions, but not direct sunlight. Heat is fine because they react similar to a cacti in hot conditions. Bright rather than light (direct), is the key",
    "watering": "These are succulents which are mainly made up of water and retain a lot of water in it's foliage (for storage), similar to a cactus. The soil needs to be moist which is easy to check by placing a finger an inch deep into the soil to make sure it is not dry. It needs much less in the winter.",
    "soil": "A pot mixture used for cactus will suffice or a soil mix that drains well and is well aerated.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot when the plant has outgrown it's pot. It's best to re-pot the offsets (small aloes - pups) in separate pots once they have grown enough.",
    "fertilizer": "",
    "humidity": "Humidity is not a major concern for these, making the average room indoors sufficient.",
    "propagation": "Aloe offsets can be divided carefully and then re-potted. Pups will grow from the parent plant which are best removed when they are about 2 inches long, or when the main plant needs more room to grow. Leaf cuttings can also be taken and re-planted, although this method is not as successful. I would let cuttings dry out for at-least a few days before placing them in soil mix. Drying out allows time for the wound to heal and improve it's chance of growing."

    "temperature": "Average room temperature’s are fine. Avoid lower than 55°F/12°C in the winter.",
    "light": "As mentioned above they like light, however, direct sunshine can damage plant leaves. A mixture of light and shade is great, if you can provide it. If you see the leaves yellowing this could be caused by too much sunlight.",
    "watering": "This plant does drink a lot of water in the summer. Keeping the soil moist (not over watered) and allowing it to dry slightly near the top is a good idea.

    "watering": "It's best to allow the soil to become dry between each watering which will depend on the time of year, how much humidity and amount of sunlight it's getting. Allowing too much water to sit at the bottom of the pot with the roots will cause them to rot (avoid this).",
    "soil": "A good draining soil mix that is gritty is advisable to use, which is sold and used for cacti and succulents.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot (spring - summer) when the plant becomes root bound or the soil needs renewing. A good solid and heavy pot is best to use because Jade plants are well known for being top heavy. A heavy pot will prevent them from tipping over.",

There are a fair few types including standard, trailers, miniatures, and chimeras (a basic way to put them into a category). Various species includes different sizes, flower colors and foliage types. A grower needs to understand which type they have if they plan to propagate them - the procedure is different (for the Chimera). There are actually thousands of hybrids with various flower colors/forms and leaf types available.",
    "temperature": "Room temperatures of around 65°f / 16°c --- 75°f / 24°c are ideal. Try not to allow temperatures to decrease lower than 60°f / 15.5°c and it's advised to avoid cold drafts or abrupt temperature changes.",
    "light": "The African violet thrives in bright light, although too much direct sunlight will cause leaf problems (edges turn yellow, patches, or develop holes). I have grown mine, at best - close to east facing windows, but many other people grow them close to the south facing side. Growers will use artificial lighting to encourage blooms during winter time, using fluorescent lighting tubes. However, many of us do not want to use lighting and have the expense when we are happy enough to see the spring and summer blooms.",
    "watering": "A big mistake is to over water these or even water them with very cold water. Very cold water prevents growth, causes leaf spots and may cause a change in color. It's best to water them once the soil becomes slightly dry to the touch and water from the top or bottom. Any excess water at the bottom of a pot tray should be removed.",
    "soil": "A fast draining soil mix is best to use. I actually use the African V soil mix with 1 part vermiculite because it's cheap enough and easy to find in many stores.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot when needed (room temperature not below 70°F./21°C). I would always do this at least once every year, or even twice a year. There is no need to increase the pot size, unless it becomes pot bound or has grown larger.",
    "fertilizer": "Fertilize every couple of weeks with a balanced fertilizer that's urea-free. Or even better, a solution specifically for A.violets.",
    "humidity": "These need high humidity and plenty of gentle misting (with luke warm water, not in direct sunlight and only the leaves) for healthy growth and to flower well. You can use a humidity tray to support the correct levels that needs to have small pebbles or a layer of gravel at the bottom with water added below the surface.",

With large arching branches and long pointed leaves, it looks attractive indoors (apart from leaves dropping). The Benjamina is one of the most popular small indoor trees from this genus that grows quite slowly and needs a grower to take particular care of a few needs (lighting, watering, etc.), which is fairly easy, when you know how.",
    "temperature": "Room temperatures of around 65°f / 16°c --- 75°f / 24°c is ideal. Try not to allow temperatures to decrease lower than 50°f / 10°c, although they can handle a bit lower, without problems.",
    "light": "Bright light is what keeps the weeping fig happy, that is partially shaded. A spot that receives some sun and shade during the day is great. As mentioned previously do not move the tree, not even turning it around to prevent leaves being shed.",
    "watering": "Allow the compost to dry to a certain extent (at the top) between each watering with tepid filtered or distilled water. Over-watering and under-watering can cause the leaves to drop. To identify the problem check if the leaves are crispy or if they fold easily. If they fold then the problem could be over-watering, and if crispy the tree could be under watered. Add enough water that can seep from the top soil to the drainage holes, at the bottom of the container and remove the left over water to allow enough oxygen to the plant roots. Less watering in the winter is to be carried out.",
    "soil": "A fast draining soil-less mix is advised.",

Native to South America, the Peperomia obtusifolia is a perennial flowering epiphyte plant species. In its natural habitat it grows within high humidity forest areas making use of the nutrients provided from tree debris and the natural tropical environment. There are a number of cultivars including the dark green leaved, variegated and the Peperomia obtusifolia 'Albomarginata' that displays yellowy gold and green patched leaves.",
    "temperature": "Ideal temperatures of 65-75ºF (18-24ºC), and no lower than 50ºF (10ºC).",
    "light": "Bright light and for the variegated types some direct sunlight (couple of hours) can help them grow well. If the leaves are dark green in color it's best not to provide direct sun as it will harm them, but the variegated types may lose variegation if enough light is not provided. South, east or west facing windows are best suited, but again dependent on the leaf color.",
    "watering": "The baby rubber plant is fairly easy to water. Allow the top soil to dry out completely and then water thoroughly. You do not want to over water this plant and allow the soil to become waterlogged....so it might be best to lean towards less rather than too much when you first start growing Peperomias, as less harm can be caused compared to overwatering. During winter water sparingly as the thick leaves will store water, so don't get too concerned about the soil being dry.",
    "soil": "A peat based soil is best used that drains well. 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite or sand is a good mix. Other mixes will work well, but the main point is for the medium to drain well and be well aerated.",
    "rePotting": "You will not need to repot or pot up a size very often as this plant has a small root system. It's a good idea to change the soil or at least the top soil annually and if a young plant has out grown its current pot you may repot a size up during spring. Better to lean towards a smaller pot than a pot too large to prevent the soil becoming waterlogged. Shallow pots are a good option for Peperomias.",
    "fertilizer": "During spring - while the plant is growing use a diluted liquid fertilizer once every 2 weeks, and once a month during summer. No feeding is required from autumn to spring",
    "humidity": "This species does like a humid environment. During the warmer months you can mist the leaves and/or place the plant on a pebble tray with water at the bottom. Most homes should be fine with its natural humidity if the air is not dry.",
    "propagation": "An easy method to propagate is to take a few centimeters of stem tip cuttings. Remove a tip (petiole) with about 5 - 8 cm of tip with one or two leaves on it. Plant the cutting in a very small pot with fresh potting mix that's moist and try to provide warm temperatures of about 20ºC (68ºF), and plenty of bright light (warmth and light is the key to success). You may want to use a rooting hormone on the cut being planted. The baby rubber plant can also propagate with leaf cuttings, although variegated types may lose the variegation. You may want to experiment and try a few leaves and stem tips to see what propagation method works best for you. I would allow leaves or stem tip cuttings a day to dry out until planted. Wait for new growth and be careful not to overwater the move a pot size up once plenty of growth has happened."

They are known as the slipper orchid and can grow to a height of around 15-30 cm. They form part of a group known as terrestrial orchids which means that they grow in the ground but unlike other terrestrial orchids they do not produce pseudobulbs which are found at the base of the stems. The Paphiopedilum are also split into two cultural groups. The first is the warm-growing group that has mottled like leaves which are great for beginners and the second group is the cool-growing group that has plain-green leaves.",

The cool group prefer daytime temperatures of around 65-70ºF (18-21ºC) and night time temperatures of around 55-62ºF (12.5-16.5ºC).",
    "light": "A diminished light is preferred by the paphiopedilum and a window that faces the east or west is ideal, however, a south facing window is fine as long as the sunlight is not directly hitting the plant.",
    "watering": "It is vital to water the Paphiopedium in the morning as this allows the water to evaporate from the foliage throughout the day which helps to prevent problems such as bacteria and fungus rot.

    "temperature": "Phals like their warmth during the day and cool during the night. Room temperatures of around 65 - 85°F (16 - 24°C) during the day and 60 - 65°F ( 16 - 18°C) at night, are ideal growing conditions.",
    "light": "Providing enough light can be a problem for some growers because the moth orchid prefers bright light conditions for more than 10 hours a day. An east or west facing window is best suited - away from direct sun, but bright. During the winter you may have to supplement the plant with artificial lighting.",
    "watering": "Once the orchid soil becomes dry to the touch, water thoroughly. Avoid allowing water to keep the soil soaked; you want it to drain away easily. Avoid watering the middle of the plants foliage (crown) because the water sitting here for a period of time may cause rot. Do not over-water!",
    "soil": "Using an orchid potting mix is a good idea. A mix is likely to contain peat moss, perlite and fir bark or another combination, if it drains well. This soil needs to replaced every two years.",
    "rePotting": "The potting mix used for phals needs to be changed at least once every 2 years, during spring. The potting mix will start to become a problem for the plant when it becomes old and deteriorates. I would re-pot in a pot similar to the size of the roots and pot it's already growing in, then remove unsavoury roots whilst re-potting. The roots that were sitting on the top of the soil need to be placed back in that position and not buried.",
    "fertilizer": "Feed from spring until fall with a diluted orchid liquid fertilizer, once every 1 - 2 weeks.",
    "humidity": "Avoid placing your plant in a room with dry air from artificial heating without supplementing humidity levels from a humidity tray (or other means). Orchids in their natural habitat thrive in high humidity conditions. Mist the leaves.",
    "propagation": "The orchid can be propagated by division, which is a good idea when the plants roots have matured. Divide the mature plant during re-potting time. Another method is called keiki which is a baby plant produced by the mother plant growing from the node. Some growers will use a keiki hormone paste to encourage and force the mother plant to produce a baby plant."

    "temperature": "They do well in temperatures varying from 55 degrees at night up to 90 degrees in the day. You can safely put your orchid outside during the summer months. A drop in temperature during the evening is required.",
    "light": "Orchids don't like direct sunlight as it can damage the leaves. The best is medium or filtered light and a room on the southern, eastern or western side. Morning direct sun is fine but not afternoon summer direct sunlight. You can go down the artificial lighting route if required and this is what many professional growers do.",
    "watering": "Cattleyas like to dry out between the waterings. The established plants should be watered from a week to ten days, and young plants from five to seven days. To make sure you are doing the best you can, you can place the pot in a bowl of water for 10-15 minutes - this works the best for the plants in clay pots. If your orchid is planted in a plastic pot, put it in an empty bowl and slowly add water. Keep it there for 10-15 minutes. In both cases you can also put the plant in a sink and use tepid water for a minute or so.",
    "soil": "They do well in soiless mixtures, for example bark, rocks, or perlite (their roots need air) . They are epiphytes in their natural habitat meaning they cling to trees and rocks without soil. Wet soil for a period of time will kill these plants.",

    "description": "While this epiphyte plant - which is native to the rainforests in south America is a flowering plant, it's primarily grown indoors for its attractive foliage and the height it grows up to. It's a plant that becomes a focal point of a room once it matures. The holes and cuts within the leaves are said to form so the plant survives well within it's natural rain forest habitat when strong winds and heavy downpours (I mean very heavy) appear. Leaves without these cuts and holes would get broken easily because of their size and the force of the weather conditions. The Swiss cheese plant is fairly easy to care for and maintain.",
    "temperature": "Temperatures between 65-80ºF (18-27ºC) are ideal. Lower than 65ºF (18Cº) will slow down this plants growth and below 50ºF (10ºC) will stop growth.",
    "light": "A fairly bright room or bright with plenty of shade is best. Direct sunlight will damage the leaves and not enough light can slow growth down.",
    "watering": "Between watering times allow the soil to become dry to the touch within the top couple of inches or so of soil.",
    "soil": "A peat based potting soil mix with perlite or sand is ideal. Soil that drains well is needed.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot once every two years approximately, during spring.",
    "fertilizer": "There is different advice from various sources about feeding (none wrong), but I would suggest fertilizing once a month with a diluted solution.",
    "humidity": "Average to high room humidity is needed, so you will need to increase the humidity of a normal room. Misting the leaves is helpful.",
    "propagation": "Propagate from a mature stem tip cuttings during summer below an aerial root at the node. Place the stem cutting about 1 or 2 inches deep in moist potting soil and water moderately. It should begin rooting within the first couple of weeks or so."

These have been cultivated in Taiwan to produce the braided types in various sizes including successful bonsai’s, which are exported to Europe, US and other countries.",
    "temperature": "Room temperatures from 65-75ºF (18-24ºC) are suitable, and no lower than 50ºF (10ºC).",
    "light": "Try your best to provide the plant with as much light as possible - without direct sunlight which can scorch the leaves. During the winter the amount of daylight time decreases, which will naturally tell the plant it's time to rest and slow it's growth down, so do not become concerned about it no longer producing new shoots and leaves.",
    "watering": "Thoroughly water the plant once the soil becomes dry and remove excess water from the pot tray. During the winter the pachira will slow it's growth right down and will not need to be watered anywhere near as much like in spring and summer. Do not over-water or have the plant in a pot which can become waterlogged.",
    "soil": "A peat moss based mix is suitable. A good mix can be made with 2 parts peat and one part perlite or sand (for drainage).",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot once every two years, during spring. The pachira wont need a pot much bigger than the one it resides in now, if it's grown more, otherwise the same pot will be fine. Keeping the tree small requires the plant to stay in a small pot with only a soil change.",
    "fertilizer": "A balanced liquid fertilizer diluted should be fed to the plant every 2 weeks which will encourage growth and healthy leaves. Feed from spring and stop just before winter or when growth really slows down, whichever comes first.",
    "humidity": "Above average room humidity is the best growing conditions to grow a money plant. During the summer increase levels with a humidity tray (tray with pebbles and water which the plants sits on) or a humidifier. During the winter avoid the plant becoming affected by dry air from artificial heating.",
    "propagation": "Propagate using 5 - 7 inch long stem tip cutting with at-least one node and only 1 or 2 sets of leaves. Use rooting hormone on the cut and re-pot in moist potting mix. For best results try and provide temperatures of 75 - 80บF (24บC - 27บC) and increase humidity. Don’t move the cutting from the pot until you see plenty of new growth, which could take 6 weeks or so (depending on the conditions it's growing in)."

It's sometimes named prayer plant when sold at garden stores and its common name (Zebra) is also given to the Aphelandra squarrosa. Being a tropical plant native to Brazil the Calathea does require a warm and moist environment which encourages the foliage to thrive and look its best.",

    "light": "In its natural habitat the Calathea dwells in forest areas shaded by trees without direct sunlight, which is why a bright but shaded spot within a warm greenhouse or conservatory suits them very well. Anywhere else indoors just needs to be bright without direct sunlight.",
    "watering": "During the growing season water the plant thoroughly and keep the soil moist (remember this plant loves moisture). When it's winter growing slows down or stops, reduce watering and you can allow the top soil to become slightly dry between each watering. If you can - use tepid rain or distilled water and avoid cold hard water.",
