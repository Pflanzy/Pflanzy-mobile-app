    "description": "The Aloe Vera plant (succulent type) is well known for offering possible health and beauty benefits that I will discuss further on. This succulent is a tough species that is very easy to care for and rarely presents problems for most growers.",
    "temperature": "Temperatures averaging 70°F/21°C - 80°F/26°C are very good and not much below 50°F/10°C",
    "light": "The A.Vera thrives on bright light conditions, but not direct sunlight. Heat is fine because they react similar to a cacti in hot conditions. Bright rather than light (direct), is the key",
    "watering": "These are succulents which are mainly made up of water and retain a lot of water in it's foliage (for storage), similar to a cactus. The soil needs to be moist which is easy to check by placing a finger an inch deep into the soil to make sure it is not dry. It needs much less in the winter.",
    "soil": "A pot mixture used for cactus will suffice or a soil mix that drains well and is well aerated.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot when the plant has outgrown it's pot. It's best to re-pot the offsets (small aloes - pups) in separate pots once they have grown enough.",
    "fertilizer": "No info",
    "humidity": "Humidity is not a major concern for these, making the average room indoors sufficient.",
    "propagation": "Aloe offsets can be divided carefully and then re-potted. Pups will grow from the parent plant which are best removed when they are about 2 inches long, or when the main plant needs more room to grow. Leaf cuttings can also be taken and re-planted, although this method is not as successful. I would let cuttings dry out for at-least a few days before placing them in soil mix. Drying out allows time for the wound to heal and improve it's chance of growing."

    "description": "The Jade is grown indoors and borrows itself from the bonsai in the way it grows like a miniature tree, with a trunk and branches. It is also a succulent that will retain water well within the leaves, just like the cactus plant. This succulent is a hardy fellow and has two main requirements for a healthy long life, which is water and plenty of light. They are both an indoor and outdoor species, although conditions outside need to be right (enough heat and sun).",
    "temperature": "Room temperatures of around 60°f / 15.5°c --- 75°f / 24°c are ideal. Winter no less than 50°f / 10°c.",
    "light": "The jade plant flourishes in good health with plenty of light. If you can provide a few hours of sunshine a day your going to have a happy plant.",
    "watering": "It's best to allow the soil to become dry between each watering which will depend on the time of year, how much humidity and amount of sunlight it's getting. Allowing too much water to sit at the bottom of the pot with the roots will cause them to rot (avoid this).",
    "soil": "A good draining soil mix that is gritty is advisable to use, which is sold and used for cacti and succulents.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot (spring - summer) when the plant becomes root bound or the soil needs renewing. A good solid and heavy pot is best to use because Jade plants are well known for being top heavy. A heavy pot will prevent them from tipping over.",
    "fertilizer": "Feed each week or two (maybe less) with a weak or diluted liquid fertilizer. Fertilizer made for succulents may be your best bet, that does not need to be a high strength type.",
    "humidity": "They survive well in quite humid conditions naturally, although you will please them with water misting.",
    "propagation": "Propagating is achieved with leaf or stem cuttings which are placed into a soil mix, then wait until they show some growth. Before placing them in soil mix you will prevent potential problems from the sap seeping out by allowing them to dry on a windowsill, for a few days or so."

    "description": " Saintpaulia is a genus comprising of approximately 20 species and subspecies, and many varietes. There are a fair few types including standard, trailers, miniatures, and chimeras (a basic way to put them into a category). Various species includes different sizes, flower colors and foliage types. A grower needs to understand which type they have if they plan to propagate them - the procedure is different (for the Chimera). There are actually thousands of hybrids with various flower colors/forms and leaf types available.",
    "temperature": "Room temperatures of around 65°f / 16°c --- 75°f / 24°c are ideal. Try not to allow temperatures to decrease lower than 60°f / 15.5°c and it's advised to avoid cold drafts or abrupt temperature changes.",
    "light": "The African violet thrives in bright light, although too much direct sunlight will cause leaf problems (edges turn yellow, patches, or develop holes). I have grown mine, at best - close to east facing windows, but many other people grow them close to the south facing side. Growers will use artificial lighting to encourage blooms during winter time, using fluorescent lighting tubes. However, many of us do not want to use lighting and have the expense when we are happy enough to see the spring and summer blooms.",
    "watering": "A big mistake is to over water these or even water them with very cold water. Very cold water prevents growth, causes leaf spots and may cause a change in color. It's best to water them once the soil becomes slightly dry to the touch and water from the top or bottom. Any excess water at the bottom of a pot tray should be removed.",
    "soil": "A fast draining soil mix is best to use. I actually use the African V soil mix with 1 part vermiculite because it's cheap enough and easy to find in many stores.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot when needed (room temperature not below 70°F./21°C). I would always do this at least once every year, or even twice a year. There is no need to increase the pot size, unless it becomes pot bound or has grown larger.",
    "fertilizer": "Fertilize every couple of weeks with a balanced fertilizer that's urea-free. Or even better, a solution specifically for A.violets.",
    "humidity": "These need high humidity and plenty of gentle misting (with luke warm water, not in direct sunlight and only the leaves) for healthy growth and to flower well. You can use a humidity tray to support the correct levels that needs to have small pebbles or a layer of gravel at the bottom with water added below the surface.",
    "propagation": "A.voilets are propagated by leaf cuttings (Chimera AVs only by suckers), placed into a potting mix."

    "description": "The flowering maple plant is from the large Abutilon genus of plants that grows up to approximately 5ft tall and blooms attractive bell shaped flowers. Some of these are classed as foliage plants and others are flowering, although foliage types can delight a grower with flowers in the summer.",
    "temperature": "They thrive in summer conditions and prefer temperature’s from 60°F-15.5°C/ 80°F-26.6°C . Avoid lower than 50°F/10°C in the winter.",
    "light": "As mentioned above these love sunshine and bright rooms near windows. The maple will also thank you for taking it outside in the summer.",
    "watering": "The flowering maple likes to be watered frequently throughout spring and summer and a lot less in the winter. Do check the top of the soil (just about dry is good) and the bottom of the tray or pot to make sure your not over-watering it, although this is rarely a problem.",
    "soil": "An all-purpose potting mix will do the trick, as they are not so fussy.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot the maple within spring in a pot that is only slightly bigger than it's roots. A pot too large will allow this sneaky shrub to grow much bigger than you may like.",
    "fertilizer": "No info",
    "humidity": "Humidity is not a major concern for these. Misting the leaves every so often is a good idea.",
    "propagation": "Propagate taking stem cuttings (3\"-4\") or sowing seeds in spring that germinate (sprout) in approx 3 weeks."

    "description": "The Bird of Paradise is delightfully easy to care for and enjoys warm, balmy days year round. The stunning flowers of this unique plant make it popular in gardens around the globe. The strelitzia reginae (scientific name) is one of the most spectacular flowering plants that can be grown indoors, when the correct conditions are provided.",
    "temperature": "The Bird of Paradise requires moderate temperatures year-round. They can tolerate temperatures as low as 55 ºF (13 ºC), but prefer to remain in the 70-90 ºF (21-32 ºC) range. Above 70 ºF (21 ºC), care instructions do change slightly.",
    "light": "This plant demands bright, yet indirect, sunlight year-round. Too much sunlight will injure the flowers. Above 70 ºF (21 ºC), this plant should be relocated to a partial shade environment in order to avoid sunburn on the flowers.",
    "watering": "During the summer months, the soil should be kept moist through regular watering. Throughout the fall and winter, permit the soil to almost dry out before watering. Never permit water to stand in the saucer underneath the plant.",
    "soil": "Strelitzia reginae does well in almost any type of soil. A standard potting soil will suffice for this plant's continued health.",
    "rePotting": "Check the roots of this plant in the late winter. If the roots appear to be cramped in the current container, have someone assist you in moving it to a size larger pot. Be careful not to injure the spathe during the transplant process. Also, re-pot young plants which are growing early spring.",
    "fertilizer": "Offer this plant a balanced fertilizer every two weeks throughout the spring and summer. During the fall and winter months fertilization to once every month.",
    "humidity": "This plant prefers normal air humidity inside the home. During the winter months, you can mist the leaves of the plants to simulate rainfall, which will also improve humidity during the months that artificial heating is used.",
    "propagation": "The Strelitzia can be propagated from seeds or by division. The seeds are woody, brown and small, with tufts of orange on them. When propagating from seed, it will take the newly formed plant up to three years to begin blooming. When propagated by division, the process interrupts the growth cycle of the parent plant, resulting in a year without blooms."

    "description": "There are more than 80 different species (plus many many hybrids) of paphiopedilum and many of them thrive in the high hills of Northern India and even the lowlands of the Philippines. They grow in a range of different colors and forms. Due to their ease of growing they are extremely popular with many people being lifelong admirers. They are known as the slipper orchid and can grow to a height of around 15-30 cm. They form part of a group known as terrestrial orchids which means that they grow in the ground but unlike other terrestrial orchids they do not produce pseudobulbs which are found at the base of the stems. The Paphiopedilum are also split into two cultural groups. The first is the warm-growing group that has mottled like leaves which are great for beginners and the second group is the cool-growing group that has plain-green leaves.",
    "temperature": "As the paphiopedilum comes in two groups- warm and cool, the warm group prefer temperatures around 70-80ºF (21-26.5ºC) during the day and around 55-65ºF (12.5-18ºC) during the night. The cool group prefer daytime temperatures of around 65-70ºF (18-21ºC) and night time temperatures of around 55-62ºF (12.5-16.5ºC).",
    "light": "A diminished light is preferred by the paphiopedilum and a window that faces the east or west is ideal, however, a south facing window is fine as long as the sunlight is not directly hitting the plant.",
    "watering": "It is vital to water the Paphiopedium in the morning as this allows the water to evaporate from the foliage throughout the day which helps to prevent problems such as bacteria and fungus rot. As the plant is nearing dryness is the right time to water it and rainwater is preferred but it is advised to not use softened water. Watering should take place at intervals of around 3-7 days.",
    "soil": "An orchid potting mix will suffice but 2 part fine-grade fir bark, 1 part perlite or sand and 1 part sphagnum moss will work just as well.",
    "rePotting": "The best time to re-pot is during the spring or early summer as well as autumn when the temperatures are warmer. For plants in 3.25” pots or larger a medium grade orchid bark mix will work well. Those plants that have a large number of growths can be divided, whilst it is advised to pot the oldest growth close to the rim of the pot which will allow another two years growth.",
    "fertilizer": "Paphiopedilum are not heavy feeders and can be given a quarter strength balanced liquid fertilizer.",
    "humidity": "Paphs enjoy humidity and dislike dry air. To improve humidity in the home for this plant place the plant pot on top of a tray of pebbles. The tray should have water within it evaporating under the plant.",
    "propagation": "Once the plant has flowered, separate an offshoot that has a solid root system and has established on the edge of a large clump, then pot individually."

    "description": "Native to South Africa this species is a perennial in warmer climates but in cooler countries (temperate regions) it's grown as an annual and flowering pot plant. There are many varieties and hybrids sold that are more compact in growth than the basic type. The basic type has stalks which grow up to 2ft tall that can become quite lanky and unattractive. The attractive bright colored flowers has made Gebera daisies an excellent bridal bouquet choice. For those that prefer to have them closer to their skin - they are also a popular floral tattoo choice.",
    "temperature": "Average temperatures of 55 - 75°F (13 - 24°C) are suitable.",
    "light": "A lover of direct sunlight and bright windowsills. Place close to a south, east or west facing window to provide enough sunlight.",
    "watering": "It's best to keep the soil moist at all times. Once the soil becomes slightly dry to the touch provide water straight away or the plant will begin to wilt very quickly.",
    "soil": "A peat based potting mix with 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite is suggested.",
    "rePotting": "No info",
    "fertilizer": "While flowering, feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks.",
    "humidity": "Gerbera's quite like above average humidity levels, although average is absolutely fine.",
    "propagation": "These are mostly propagated with seeds although the parent plant can also be divided or root cuttings can be used."

    "description": "The flamingo flower plant is a species from the Anthuirum genus that displays great looking waxed effect flowers which bloom with an orange curly spadix. The Anthurium scherzerianum from the genus is suitable for a room within a home because of the acceptable height it grows up to, and of course the attractive spathe it displays for décor purposes.",
    "temperature": "Average room temperatures from 65°F/18.3°C - 75°F/23.8°C (maybe a little higher and not below 60°F/15.5°C). Lower temperatures will affect it's leaves (may turn yellow), impede it's growth and flowering.",
    "light": "The flamingo flower is a lover of light - but not direct sunlight.",
    "watering": "Keeping the soil moist at all times within the summer is advisable. Water every couple of days and less in the winter.",
    "soil": "A good draining soil is best suited, such as a peat moss based potting soil and perlite.",
    "rePotting": "These are re-potted within spring usually every 2 years, or when they become pot-bound.",
    "fertilizer": "No info",
    "humidity": "The flamingo loves being misted with a light spray of lukewarm water, regulary. Cleaning lightly with a gentle sponge is advised, which improves humidity - and makes it look healthy.",
    "propagation": "Propagate by dividing the plant when you decide to re-pot in spring. Having a good temperature above 75°F/23.8°C for the first few weeks will give the plant a great start in life."

    "temperature": "Phals like their warmth during the day and cool during the night. Room temperatures of around 65 - 85°F (16 - 24°C) during the day and 60 - 65°F ( 16 - 18°C) at night, are ideal growing conditions.",
    "description": "Moth orchid is the common name for the phalaenopsis orchid that's quickly become one of the most popular species from the orchidaceae familyName of flowering plants. Glorious colored blooms all year round and the \"ease of growing\" is what makes these a popular house plant choice.",
    "light": "Providing enough light can be a problem for some growers because the moth orchid prefers bright light conditions for more than 10 hours a day. An east or west facing window is best suited - away from direct sun, but bright. During the winter you may have to supplement the plant with artificial lighting.",
    "watering": "Once the orchid soil becomes dry to the touch, water thoroughly. Avoid allowing water to keep the soil soaked; you want it to drain away easily. Avoid watering the middle of the plants foliage (crown) because the water sitting here for a period of time may cause rot. Do not over-water!",
    "soil": "Using an orchid potting mix is a good idea. A mix is likely to contain peat moss, perlite and fir bark or another combination, if it drains well. This soil needs to replaced every two years.",
    "rePotting": "The potting mix used for phals needs to be changed at least once every 2 years, during spring. The potting mix will start to become a problem for the plant when it becomes old and deteriorates. I would re-pot in a pot similar to the size of the roots and pot it's already growing in, then remove unsavoury roots whilst re-potting. The roots that were sitting on the top of the soil need to be placed back in that position and not buried.",
    "fertilizer": "Feed from spring until fall with a diluted orchid liquid fertilizer, once every 1 - 2 weeks.",
    "humidity": "Avoid placing your plant in a room with dry air from artificial heating without supplementing humidity levels from a humidity tray (or other means). Orchids in their natural habitat thrive in high humidity conditions. Mist the leaves.",
    "propagation": "The orchid can be propagated by division, which is a good idea when the plants roots have matured. Divide the mature plant during re-potting time. Another method is called keiki which is a baby plant produced by the mother plant growing from the node. Some growers will use a keiki hormone paste to encourage and force the mother plant to produce a baby plant."

    "description": "Cattleya Orchid is one of the most popular kind of orchids, especially as cut flowers, as it comes with variety of colors and lasts for quite a long time. This species is also known as the 'corsage orchid' because ladies liked to use the flowers as accessories for their evening dresses back in the day.",
    "temperature": "They do well in temperatures varying from 55 degrees at night up to 90 degrees in the day. You can safely put your orchid outside during the summer months. A drop in temperature during the evening is required.",
    "light": "Orchids don't like direct sunlight as it can damage the leaves. The best is medium or filtered light and a room on the southern, eastern or western side. Morning direct sun is fine but not afternoon summer direct sunlight. You can go down the artificial lighting route if required and this is what many professional growers do.",
    "watering": "Cattleyas like to dry out between the waterings. The established plants should be watered from a week to ten days, and young plants from five to seven days. To make sure you are doing the best you can, you can place the pot in a bowl of water for 10-15 minutes - this works the best for the plants in clay pots. If your orchid is planted in a plastic pot, put it in an empty bowl and slowly add water. Keep it there for 10-15 minutes. In both cases you can also put the plant in a sink and use tepid water for a minute or so.",
    "soil": "They do well in soiless mixtures, for example bark, rocks, or perlite (their roots need air) . They are epiphytes in their natural habitat meaning they cling to trees and rocks without soil. Wet soil for a period of time will kill these plants.",
    "rePotting": "No info",
    "fertilizer": "Any balanced orchid fertilizer is good. Use it weekly.",
    "humidity": "Around 40% - 70%. Place the pot on pebbles in water to create more humidity from the water evaporating from the pebble tray.",
    "propagation": "Propagate in spring, after blooming period. This is done by dividing the plant and there should be at least three shoots on each division."

    "description": "The Blossfeldiana is the most popular succulent plant from the Kalanchoe genus, mainly grown for its flowering ability rather than its foliage - unlike many other succulents. Growers can motivate the plant to bloom at any time of the year, although they're naturally spring bloomers. The green leaves will become a reddish color around the edges, if given enough sunlight.",
    "temperature": "Average room temperatures from 65°F/18.3°C - 75°F/23.8°C and no lower than 50°F/10°C, is best; avoiding frost if they are grown or sitting outside for a period of time.",
    "light": "The F. katy is a tough plant which can tolerate various lighting conditions, although it enjoys resting on a windowsill that is bright, but not too much direct sunlight during the summer. Some growers around October time will try and provide the plant with plenty of dark hours at night (up to 14 hours) to allow it to rest to encourage future blooms.",
    "watering": "Because it's a succulent it will hold water within it's leaves. There's no need to keep the soil damp all the time. When they need watering it's a good idea to give them plenty and then allow the soil to become dry again.",
    "soil": "When grown outside the plant thrives in most soils. Grown indoors a good potting mix that drains well will suffice.",
    "rePotting": "These are re-potted around spring time. Do be careful when re-potting because the leaves can snap easily. They are kind of brittle.",
    "fertilizer": "A standard liquid fertiliser diluted can be used once a month or so from spring until the end of summer. Check the instructions, for the fertilizer bought.",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is fine and they do not require misting.",
    "propagation": "These are easily propagated by stem cuttings or leaf cuttings ( spring or summer). Treat them like other succulents and allow the cutting to dry out for a few days, then plant the cuttings in soil. A root should be forming within a couple of weeks or so, and then wait for new growth."

    "description": "If your a grower needing a plant for a center piece in a room or a focal point, this is one of those types of species which looks the part. Once it begins to mature and grows over 4 feet in height it makes an ideal office or hotel plant and looks the business in large living rooms and hallways. What's great about growing a corn plant as well as how attractive they look is they're fairly easy to care for and maintain - like many other dracaena plants.",
    "temperature": "Temperatures from 60°F (15°C) - 75°F (24°C) are ideal. Under 55°F/12°C is going to harm the plant which may become noticeable if the leaves begin curling. Try and avoid the plant being near cold drafts, which will also cause harm.",
    "light": "A good mix of sun shine and shade is ideal for this dracaena, but hardly any direct sunlight. Although it grows quicker and better in bright light you'll also find it survives and grows well enough in low light conditions.",
    "watering": "I would advise a grower to keep the soil slightly damp to the touch and in the winter slightly dry.",
    "soil": "Most well draining potting soil mix types are fine to use.",
    "rePotting": "I would suggest re-potting once very 2 -3 years and a pot one size bigger if it's becoming terribly pot bound. Slightly pot bound is fine.",
    "fertilizer": "From April until September use a liquid fertilizer that's diluted - once every 2 - 3 weeks, whilst it's growing.",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is fine.",
    "propagation": "These are quite easy to propagate from stem tip cuttings, best done in spring or summer. You can also cut a new or old rosette and re-plant it. After replanting keep the soil moist and mist the leaves which will encourage the plant to grow. A tall plant can be propagated using the air layering method."

    "description": "The sansevieria trifasciata picked up the name mother in laws tongue from the sharpness of the evergreen sword like leaves that grow in an upward fashion. As mentioned above this plant is a flowering type, however, grown indoors it's fairly hard to encourage flowers (not impossible).",
    "temperature": "Average warmth is fine of approximately 60-75°F (15-24°C) and no lower than 50°F (10°C).",
    "light": "The mother in laws tongue is well known for coping with direct sun and low light conditions, although bright light conditions with some sun light and shade is preferred.",
    "watering": "Because this plant is a succulent it stores water within its foliage, so it is not necessary to keep the soil damp. Water from spring to fall when the soil becomes dry to the touch and during the winter only once a month. Be careful not to over water as this can cause the root and base of the plant to rot.",
    "soil": "I would just use a common well draining cactus and succulent potting mix available from all garden stores.",
    "rePotting": "The snake plant does not enjoy being re-potted very often, so re-pot only when the pot cracks from growth. They're best potted within a clay pot that can crack once maximum growth space within the pot is used.",
    "fertilizer": "During the main growing season (spring - fall) feed with a diluted cactus and succulent fertilizer once a month.",
    "humidity": "Average house humidity is advised - but this plant can tolerate dry air conditions and drafts.",
    "propagation": "Propagate by division when its re-potting time or when you see enough plant growth. You may also remove offsets that appear near the base of the plant or propagate 2 inch leaf tip cuttings. Dividing the plant seems to be the most successful approach."

    "description": "Amaryllis hippeastrum are bulb flowering type plants that produce a cluster of attractive trumpet like flowers in different color variation. Some confusion over the years has occurred between the hippeastrum and amaryllis when both are actually a separate genus.",
    "temperature": "The amaryllis within the growing period (winter - spring) prefers temperatures of 70 - 75F°f (21 - 24°c) and from September - November (or early December) 55°f (13°c). After the plant as flowered the temperature can be kept at around 70 - 75F°f (21 - 24°c) which will keep the flower healthier longer.",
    "light": "Bright light without too much direct sunlight is preferable.",
    "watering": "During the growing and flowering period, water when the top inch of the soil becomes dry. Once the leaves are cut away you can stop watering for about 8 – 10 weeks (dormant period) or water sparingly until new growth appears. When new leaves appear water frequently again when the top inch of soil becomes dry. Overwatering may cause the bulb to rot.",
    "soil": "You can use equal part perlite and peat or two parts loam soil and one part perlite. Your local garden store will offer other suitable options as well.",
    "rePotting": "Your hippeastrum can be re-potted if the bulb seems to have outgrown the pot or every 2 years just before the dormant growing period (Nov - Dec). The pot size needs to be approximatively 2 inches wider each side of the bulb.",
    "fertilizer": "After the dormant period (Nov -Dec) begin feeding with a liquid fertilizer once every 2 weeks once you begin to see leaf shoots appearing. Continue until the leaves are cut down ready for the dormant period (Sept - Nov).",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is fine.",
    "propagation": "These can be propagated by seed (takes up to 5 years to mature and flower) or bulb offsets. Propagating with offsets takes about half the time to produce a mature plant that flowers compared to planting seeds (about 3 years)."

    "description": "This amazing bulb based plant 'beach spider lily' enjoys environments that are downright aquatic and easy to maintain. These one of a kind flowers will look like spiders crawling across your flower's shelving unit all summer long, and provide your home with a sweet vanilla scent.",
    "temperature": "The Beach Spider Lily is capable of withstanding temperatures that drop into the 40ºF (4°C) range, and as high as 90ºF (32ºC). They must be protected against frosts by all means, or the plant will die back to the bulb stage.",
    "light": "This plant requires partial shade to full sun. Make certain it can get enough light from the pot location.",
    "watering": "Hymenocallis littoralis demands wet conditions all year long. The bulbs can be started in nothing except water, but need to be moved to soil once they begin to sprout. Soil should be kept moist, but never soggy. Do not allow standing water in the saucer underneath.",
    "soil": "These plants prefer a standard potting soil mixed with bark or pumice at a 1:1 ratio. The pH of the soil chosen needs to be between 5.0 and 7.5 for the continued health of the plant.",
    "rePotting": "Every two years, this plant requires re-potting and an infusion of new soil. Move the plant to a size larger pot, and mix in new soil to fill the gaps. This should be done when the plant is not flowering.",
    "fertilizer": "You may fertilize your plant once every two weeks with a diluted balanced fertilizer. Seaweed based fertilizers have been reported to produce the best results.",
    "humidity": "This plant is happy with normal air humidity, as long as its soil is properly moist. If the soil has been allowed to dry out, the leaves and flowers may be misted with a spray bottle to combat dehydration effects.",
    "propagation": "This plant is propagated either by seed or by dividing rhizomes. Maturity from seed takes several years. It is easier to break off a piece of the bulb and propagate from it."

    "description": "Growing advice for the Belladonna lily (common name) Amaryllis (genus). Also known as the naked lady because of the bare flower stalks that appear without leaves. While these flowering bulbous plants are mainly grown outside they are suitable bulb type species which will grow and flower indoors - with the correct conditions provided. ",
    "temperature": "Temperatures from 65 - 75F°f (18 - 24°c) are best suited.",
    "light": "Bright and direct sunlight is advisable. To stand any chance of getting the belladonna lily to flower it's best to have the plant near a south-facing window, where it can get the most hours of sunshine.",
    "watering": "Keep the soil moist (not soaked) during the growing and flowering period. During the rest period after the leaves have died down, do not water until the stalk appears and then begin watering as normal.",
    "soil": "You can use equal part perlite and peat or two parts loam soil and one part perlite. Your local garden center may also be able to offer other suitable options. Make sure the bulb is planted within a large plant pot.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot in a fairly large pot that gives the plant plenty of room for it's roots. Once every 2 -3 years should be fine.",
    "fertilizer": "Once the leaves appear you can fertilize with a diluted liquid fertilizer once a month. Do not feed during the rest period and begin again once the stalk appears. Feeding will help belladonna lily plants to flower, however, it's not necessary to do so and it's much better to give less or none at all - than too much.",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is fine.",
    "propagation": "These can be propagated by seed, bulb offsets or rhizome's."

    "description": "The Impatiens Walleriana is a favorite within many households within the UK and US, and named busy lizzie in the UK and patient lucy within the US. Grown for their attractive blooms outdoors (just about everywhere) and indoors when given enough bright light and the correct temperatures. Most of these that are widely sold today are walleriana hybrids.",
    "temperature": "Average room temperatures from 65°F/18.3°C - 75°F/23.8°C (not below 60°F/15.5°C).",
    "light": "Bright light is key to these blooming and during winter. Direct sun light is be to avoided during the summer.",
    "watering": "Keep the soil moist at all times but not soaking wet. During the growing season you will notice they drink a lot.",
    "soil": "A well draining potting soil mix will suffice.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot during spring if the plant has become pot bound, but keep in mind the patient lucy likes plenty of roots in it's pot. When re-potting use a pot slightly bigger than the last one the plant resided in - with plenty of drainage holes.",
    "fertilizer": "Impatiens walleriana's grow well when fed with a balanced liquid fertilizer during spring and summer. I would say feeding once every 4 weeks is about right.",
    "humidity": "Most indoor humidly levels are fine for this plant.",
    "propagation": "Stem cuttings (3 -5 inches) can be taken at any time of the year and re-potted to produce new busy lizzies. These can also be grown by seed which are sown during spring."

    "description": "Although an outdoor plant by nature, the Calla Lily will perform wonderfully as an indoor plant. Keeping this rhizome happy indoors is a matter of paying attention to some very basic growing conditions. The Zantedeschia aethiopica is native to southern Africa. As such, this plant is used to very different growing conditions than are found naturally in other parts of the world.",
    "temperature": "These flowers can be rather picky about their temperatures. For ideal growing conditions expose the bulbs to days no hotter than 65°F and no colder than 55°F. The above ground plant can tolerate temperatures as high as 75°F. If your home is hot, use mulch to keep the bulb cooler in its pot.",
    "light": "This plant requires plenty of bright sunlight during non-peak hours of the day. Provide it with a sunny window facing east or west for best results.",
    "watering": "Zantedeschia aethiopica is a water loving plant. It grows best on the edges of ponds and in the mud. Because of this, your indoor lily will prefer moist conditions. Keep the soil always moist, but never allow water to sit in the container. Too much water will cause the bulb to rot.",
    "soil": "Standard potting soil is a good mixture for this plant. Avoid potting soils with an unbalanced pH or too much fertilizer mixed in.",
    "rePotting": "This plant takes to re-potting well. Simply dig the plant out of the soil, including the entire bulb. Replant the bulb with the shoots pointing up at least three inches deep in the soil. Cover, and water once. Wait until new growth is evident before watering again.",
    "fertilizer": "The Calla Lily normally doesn't need fertilizer. If you desire better growth, use a fertilizer with no ammonium in it. Use this in a mixture of 1 part fertilizer to 1 gallon of water, and fertilize once every two weeks for a single season only. Continued fertilization for long periods of time will harm the plant.",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is acceptable for this plant, as long as the soil is kept moist. This is especially true during winter.",
    "propagation": "If the Calla Lily is fertilized, small black berries will form. These can be dried out and planted in three inches of potting soil. This will form new bulbs. Otherwise, you can dig up the rhizome and break off a section of it. Permit this to dry for two days, then plant with the non-smooth side up and water according to re-potting instructions."

    "description": "The Caladium (common names: heart of Jesus, angel wings and elephant ear) is a tuber plant grown for its attractive papery thin and bi-colored leaves. The only down side of seeing the foliage produce its lovely color is that it soon dies off until the next year.",
    "temperature": "Above 70ºF (21ºC) is the best temperature to provide, and no lower than 60ºF (15ºC)",
    "light": "In their natural habitat the heart of Jesus plant grows in shaded areas. Indoors that can be artificially provided with a fairly bright room, without direct sun light. Direct sun will scorch and damage the leaves.",
    "watering": "After the tubers show signs of growth (small shoots) water frequently - and keep the soil moist.",
    "soil": "A nutrient rich and well draining potting soil is required.",
    "rePotting": "These are taken out of the pot when the foliage dies down during fall and then re-potted (as mentioned above).",
    "fertilizer": "I would feed every week with a diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season.",
    "humidity": "In it's natural habitat this plant is likely to grow with higher humidity levels than we have in our homes, but the average levels within a home should be fine.",
    "propagation": "Tubers can be divided before planting in spring. When dividing a tuber make sure at least one growing eye is available, so a stem can begin to grow."

    "description": "The false shamrock plant (oxalis triangularis) is a bulb type flowering plant which is also known as the purple shamrock or wood sorrel from the oxalis genus. The small pinkish or white colored blooms are an attractive addition to the rich purple leaves, which are the star of the show. There is also the plain green type which look similar to a four leaf clover, minus a leaf.",
    "temperature": "Temperature: Between 60 - 70°F (15 - 21°C) 'no higher than 75°F - 24°C' seems to be the ideal temperatures during the day and no lower than about 55°F (13°C) during the night.",
    "light": "A good shaded spot within the home from direct sunlight is ideal. Sat back from a window in a bright room is suitable, but if the room is more north facing, place much closer to the window.",
    "watering": "One of the worst things you can do with bulbs is over-water, which rots the bulb. Allowing the soil to begin to dry at the top is a good measurement of when to water again. Remember to stop watering if the plant becomes dormant.",
    "soil": "Most potting mixes that drain well, which are also well aerated will do the trick.",
    "rePotting": "You may want to re-pot your plant once every 1 - 2 years (during dormancy period) and use the same pot or move up a size bigger, unless your removing offsets which reduces the size of the plant 'or keeps it to the same size'.",
    "fertilizer": "A diluted liquid fertilizer is helpful to use during the growing period. Feed once every 1 or 2 weeks. No feeding is required during dormancy.",
    "humidity": "Average room humidity is fine.",
    "propagation": "If you want to propagate your oxalis triangularis you'll find it's best to do this towards the end of it's dormant period (I would do this after 2 weeks of dormancy to be sure of timing). The bulb will have to be removed from the pot and then you may remove the small bulb offsets which are re-potted to produce new plants. Be patient with the new plants and expect them to appear a little later than the main plant."

    "description": "The Christmas cactus is a plant I clearly remember growing on our windowsills at home when I was a child (some time ago now), close to a number of “money plants” mum had grown. This tough little plant baffles those who try to grow it every year. The trick to this cactus is in the realization that it is a tropical cactus, and not at all like its desert dwelling cousins.",
    "temperature": "Temperature: Best kept at 68°F (20°C), although fluctuations from 60-70°F (15-21°C) are tolerated. The plant can be kept at 55-59°F (13-15°C) will grow slowly and allow rest. Plant death can occur at below 50°F (10°C).",
    "light": "During the late fall and all winter long these plants like full, direct sunlight. At any other time of the year, the plants should be grown in partial sun conditions. Too much light during non-flowering times will cause the plant to turn yellow and fail to produce buds in the coming year.",
    "watering": "Although a cactus, this is a tropical plant. The top inch of soil should be kept moist to the touch at all times. Never allow the soil to become water-logged, or permit water to stand in the pot tray.",
    "soil": "The Christmas Cactus likes being grown in pots. It demands an easily drained growth medium. Suggested is a mixture of 60% potting soil with a pH balanced formula and either 40% bark or 40% perlite.",
    "rePotting": "This is best performed in the late spring season. Place the cactus with plenty of room in the container. Re-potting is required every three years to provide additional growth room, although they do prefer being partially pot-bound.",
    "fertilizer": "They likewise require a high dose of magnesium in the soil for proper growth, which is achieved through a mixture of 1 teaspoon Epsom salts to 1 gallon of water. This must be delivered to the plant on a monthly basis from early spring through early fall, and should be given two weeks after a regular fertilizer treatment for best results.",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is suggested for this plant. Mist leaves frequently.",
    "propagation": "Best propagated through the cutting method. Sections of stem tip's at least 3 segments long should be removed from the main plant. These must be left to dry for theree or four days. Combine the three cuttings and place at least one inch deep in soil. For best results, cuttings should be taken in early summer."

    "watering": "Watering thoroughly once the soil begins to dry to the touch, is suggested. Watering with distilled or rain water, that's tepid is advised. Do not allow the plant to sit in water within its tray because this may cause root rot (remove excess water).",
    "soil": "If you plan to re-pot after the flowering season then use a potting mix that contains peat moss, perlite and vermiculite or similar.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot if your plant roots become pot bound in a pot a couple of inches bigger from May - June.",

    "watering": "Soil should be kept constantly moist, but never soggy. Do not allow water to sit in the dish underneath.",
    "soil": "Due to its natural growing environment being on rocks or trees, this cactus requires rough soil to grow well. A 1:1 mixture of potting soil to pumice, tree bark, or perlite is required. Pumice is preferred.",
    "rePotting": "Never re-pot during the bloom or following resting period. Re-pot by removing only the loose soil around the roots. Transfer immediately to a size larger pot and pack in with appropriate soil.",
    "fertilizer": "The Easter cactus prefers fertilization every 14 days. Use a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer, and dilute to half strength. Do not fertilize during resting period.",
    "humidity": "Hatiora gaertneri requires a humid environment to survive. The plant should be misted with a sprayer daily, even during the rest period, to simulate the needed humidity.",
    "propagation": "Any segment at least 3 inches long can be used for propagation. Allow the cutting to harden for at least 48 hours. Plant the small end of the segment in shallow, moist perlite. Rooting occurs between 3-4 weeks."

    "description": "The Orchid cacti can be a picky customer, but when you treat it correctly, it will bring your home beauty for years to come. An Orchid cactus (forest type cacti) blooms multi-petalled bright funnel shaped flowers that spread out from 4 - 6 inches, and the foliage can get a little out of control. This is a tropical cactus, and will need to be watered frequently.In order to ensure blooms in the following year, these plants require a winter resting period. Beginning in December, move your orchid cactus into an unheated, dark room. Provide it with daylight during the normal hours the sun is up. Watering should be minimal during this time. Remove from resting room in early March or when buds form. This native of southern Mexico flourishes in the tropical environment. Despite the name cactus, it enjoys water. Natural growth periods are in the spring and fall only. Its scientific name has recently been changed to Disocactus ackermannii from the previous Epiphyllum ackermannii, rendering some amount of confusion in the botanical world.",
    "temperature": "Keep this cactus between 60-75ºF (16-24ºC) during its active cycle. During the resting period, daytime temperatures must be 60-65ºF (16-18ºC) and night-time temperatures must be 40-55ºF (4-12ºC).",
    "light": "These plants prefer their sunlight to be indirect or filtered. Do not expose to sunlight during the heat of the day. A healthy plant will show dark green growth with red edges if the right amount of light is being provided.",
    "watering": "The soil of Disocactus ackermannii must have careful attention paid to its moisture levels. The roots must never dry out, but the top 1/3 inch of soil should become dry between watering.",
    "soil": "Best mixture for this plant to thrive is 3 parts potting soil to 1 part pumice, bark chips, or perlite. Pumice is preferred.",
    "rePotting": "As the root system expands, your plant will need to be re-potted. Every 2 years, move the plant to a single size larger pot. Do not remove the soil from around the roots during transplant. Instead, shake the excess off, and fill in the gaps around the roots with new soil. Never re-pot within a month of blooming.",
    "fertilizer": "Once a week during the summer and fall months, offer your orchid cactus a balanced mixture of fertilizer such as 10-10-10, diluted to 1/4 teaspoon per gallon. In the spring, a blooming fertilizer such as 7-9-5 should be used. During the winter rest period, use the balanced fertilizer, but reduce feeding to once per month.",
    "humidity": "During the spring, summer, and fall, normal room humidity is tolerated. During the winter rest, humidity should be lowered with a dehumidifier in the resting room.",
    "propagation": "From seeds, this cactus takes 12-15 years to mature to the blooming stage. Propagation of a flowering plant takes one year, and is achieved by breaking off sections at least two leaf segments long. Permit the cuttings to harden for one week, then plant exactly two leaf serrations deep in soil. Water sparingly but regularly."

    "description": "The golden barrel cactus is a globe shaped type cacti suitable for growing in conservatories, on patios or any other type of indoor glass rooms. They are grown indoors inside conservatories or other glass rooms where enough sunlight is provided. However, they seem to have great difficulty flowering indoors.",
    "temperature": "Temperatures averaging 50°F/10°C - 75°F/23.8°C are ideal but not below 40°F/5°C and avoid frost.",
    "light": "Plenty of sunshine will keep this cacti more than happy. In a glass room you may have to provide some shade during a hot summers day to prevent sunburn.",
    "watering": "From spring until fall; water similar to many other house plants by watering when the soil begins drying. Before and during winter barely water the plant. Overwatering, especially when the temperature becomes cold can rot this species.",
    "soil": "A pot mixture used for cactus plants that drains well will suffice. Adding gravel or small pebbles at the bottom first few inches of the pot will encourage drainage.",
    "rePotting": "When they are young and growing it's best to re-pot these once a year; during spring in a slightly bigger container. Once they mature re-pot maybe every 2 - 3 years or when necessary.",
    "fertilizer": "Feed every 4 weeks with a high potassium fertilizer during summer.",
    "humidity": "Humidity does not seem to be a major concern for the Echinocactus grusonii, which makes the average indoor environment fine, as it is. Provide as much fresh air as you can , but not cold drafts.",
    "propagation": "These are propagated with seeds once it fruits after flowering."

    "description": "This palm (Howea) is much more of a slow growing plant than the kentia, and is a lot less popular for growing indoors. The main difference in appearance is the sentry fronds arch over more. This is a feather type palm that displays wide fronds, not as wide as the coconut palm but wider than the parlor (parlor is the most popular). Because the fronds grow wide and the tree can grow well over 8ft tall - a suitable displaying space is required, such as a hallway or hotel entrance. Like most palms in the right setting this looks fantastic.",
    "temperature": "Room temperatures of around 65°f / 16°c --- 75°f / 24°c are ideal. The temperature should not decline lower than 55°f / 12.7°c.",
    "light": "Indirect light is advisable, but not direct sunlight.",

    "description": "The Pygmy palm has very slim feather type leaflets that arch over. The only other palm I know of that has slimmer leaves is the dwarf coconut type, while others are much wider and can look more attractive indoors. The trunk is an attractive feature that grows up to 6 inches in diameter, and brown in color. Outdoors these only grow up to 6 - 10ft, so they're a manageable height indoors and outside (in the correct conditions). These are suitable to be grown and displayed in greenhouses, conservatories or any room that has enough bright light. You will see after reading the care instructions that the Phoenix roebelenii is fairly easy to grow and maintain. Some growers will produce plants with two or three trunks from seedlings next to each other.",

This hardy little plant is perfect for indoor growing and does well in the typical household environment. The Broadleaf Lady Palm is a multi-stemmed palm plant that has become increasingly popular around the world. The plant has proven successful in removing airborne toxins within the home, including ammonia, formaldehyde, xylene, and carbon dioxide. Unlike other plants, who simply make oxygen, Rhapis excelsa will actually make the air in your home cleaner and safer to breathe. It is widely known as one of the easiest house plants to grow in the world. Distinct in nature, this palm survives in households around the world, and has been grown as a house plant for over 500 years in Japan. Indoor plants are kept in check through pruning.",
    "temperature": "It is almost impossible to upset the temperature of the Broadleaf Lady Palm. It will happily tolerate temperatures from 20-100°F (-6-37°C), and can survive short stays outside of this temperature zone.",
    "light": "This palm enjoys indirect sunlight. Full sunlight will injure the leaves.",
    "watering": "Rhapis excelsa demands soil that is constantly moist, but never soggy. Do not permit standing water to collect, as it will rot the root system.",
    "soil": "Although tolerant of many soil types, this plant's standing favorite is African Violet potting soil mix.",
    "rePotting": "This plant rarely requires fertilizer. You may use a balanced 10-10-10 mixture, but it is very easy to over-fertilize and injure the plant.",

The Boston displays graceful fronds (leaves) that arch over much more than it's parent plant, so it's abnormalities have become an advantage (in the eyes of plant growers). The Sword fern has very stiff and upright fronds.

    "watering": "Moist soil at all times is advisable, without the soil becoming soggy.",
    "soil": "Peat moss potting soil mixes are best suited with perlite added combined with all-purpose soil. The soil needs to be able to retain some water but also have the ability to drain fairly well. Too much peat moss then water can become clogged and too much perlite with all-purpose will drain too quickly.",
    "rePotting": "Re-potting is done during spring once every 2 years while it's growing fast to a pot size bigger. Still change the top soil each spring even if a pot change is not required.",
    "fertilizer": "A balanced fertilizer diluted given to the plant every 2 weeks should suffice. Feed from April - Sept and don't feed after re-potting and changing the soil for one month (enough nutrients will be available in the new soil).",
    "humidity": "All ferns prefer fairly high humidity levels, however, the Boston fern is slightly more resilient and can tolerate lower levels. If you can....increase levels with a humidifier and not a humidity tray because your likely to keep the plant in a hanging basket or similar, so the plant cannot be placed in a tray.",
    "propagation": "These are propagated either by division or separating runners. The runners are small plantlets that grow from the mother plant that you will have to look out for and remove once they have grown enough to separate from the mother plant and survive independently. Dividing the plant into sections is the most popular propagation method carried out during spring. You can divide the fern into how many new plants you want by cutting though the root system for the section you require."

    "watering": "Like other succulents, the Agava americana does need more water during its growth period. Water enough to make the potting mixture moist but allow two thirds of the potting mixture to dry out before watering again. During the rest period the plant requires very little water and only enough to stop the potting mixture from drying out. In it's natural sub-tropical and semi-arid regions it spends a lot of time without water and survives well because the leaves are storage organs for water and nutrients.",
    "soil": "The Century plant does prefer a soil that drains very well. This does mean that the loam soil should be used that contains sand so that it remains moist but drains well. The soils should be PH Acid Neutral.",
    "rePotting": "The plant should be re-potted each spring while it's growing, moving it in a pot that is one size larger. To enhance drainage a layer of broken crocks in the base of the pot will help drainage. Once the plant has reached the maximum convenient pot size it should be top-dressed during the spring months.",

It is part of the Aracae family and is known as a vine and climber due to its ability to grow to huge heights given the right conditions. These plants are naturally found in humid tropical rainforests but they are also found in swamps and river banks. Due to their climbing nature they climb tree trunks and other plants in their natural habitat. The leaves have a pointy tip and have a brown tint to them, however, they rapidly turn to a lush deep green color as they mature. It is a versatile plant that can be grown in a number of different conditions which makes it perfect for both outdoor growing and indoor growing. This is a plant that has caused much discussion over its name, a discussion which has last for around 200 years. It is also known as Philodendron Oxycardium and Philodendron Cordatum, the varied names are down to the fact that it has a diverse habitat.",
    "temperature": "The ideal temperature for this plant is 60-75ºF/16-24ºC. Temperatures above and beyond this could cause the plants growth to slow down.",

These need to be kept at temperatures between 65 - 75 °F (18 - 24°C and be provided with bottom heat to improve your chances of success. Make sure you do not over-water the soil, which can begin rotting the cutting and wait until you see plenty of new growth before beginning to provide basic care conditions."

Overwatering is the worst thing you could do, especially if temperatures are cold. Water when the soil becomes dry to the touch.",
    "soil": "This is a plant that likes a loamy soil and therefore, a cactus potting mix is ideal.

    "light": "This is a plant that thrives in areas of bright sunlight which is why it should be placed south or west facing. During the winter months it will need to receive as much light as possible. Make sure that some shade during the day is given the plant otherwise too much sun could cause overheating and harm.",
    "watering": "New leaves will begin growing in Autumn and continue during the winter months and it is after the leaves have grown that the plant can be watered. It is advised to let the plant dry out in between watering as well as during the summer months (dormancy period). The plant will require very little water during the winter, spring and summer months, if at all. If in doubt, don't water is my best advice.",
    "soil": "A sandy, loamy soil is best for the Lithops optica rubra as the plant can suffer from rot if the soil does not drain sufficiently. 1 part gravel, 2 parts sand with 1 part loam is another good mix.",
    "rePotting": "It will do extremely well in the same pot for a number of years although it is advised to grow them in a smaller pot due to the fact that a large pot can inhibit the growth of flowers and the roots are very small. Prior to watering is when it should be repotted and it should be placed in a compost that is loam-based rather than organic. When repotting you could use a clay pot, this helps watering to dry out.",
    "fertilizer": "It is not advised to fertilize this plant as it can damage the tissues of the plant which can result in rot. If growers do feed them they only feed once during the winter growing season with a cactus or succulent diluted fertilizer.",
    "humidity": "A room that has good humidity will benefit the plant but the plant will not grow well in cold drafty areas. The Lithops optica also benefits from plenty of fresh air.",
    "propagation": "Propagating by seed that is sown at a temperature of around 21°C will produce the best results although they can be grown from parent plant division cuttings when more lithops have formed from the parent (this can be an issue because these plants like being clustered together) .

Rocky crevices is the preferred habitat of the Conophytum genus. Native to South Africa, the clump forming succulent Conophytum ficiforme grows within rocky crevices within partially shaded areas. They can be grown in containers indoors if the correct conditions are provided and vital care instructions are followed (i.e., soil type, watering and light).",
    "light": "A combination of direct sunlight and indirect light is best suited. A couple of hours of early morning sun or late afternoon sun is best rather than midday. During fall and winter, temperate regions get much less daylight length and this is the time light is important (growing period). If they dont get enough light they are likely to grow slower and blooms may struggle to appear, but nothing harmful should happen unless you water them too much. Some growers may use artificial lighting, grow lights.",
    "watering": "During the dormancy period in summer you'll only need to water them slightly once a month - misting is even better. After they have bloomed during fall (Oct - Nov) you may begin to water them once a week, but do check if the top soil has dried out first, and if it's not dry - dont water. The worst you can do for this plant is water it too much....it will kill it. Underwatering is not an issue and easy to notice when the leaves become wrinkly, just add water if they do, they will bounce back.",
    "soil": "Sandy and loamy soil is required, they need air and very good drainage, with a little water retention. A good mix would be 1 part gravel, 2 parts sand with 1 part loam. Ready made cactus potting mix is also fine to use, but I would still add half part sand and half part grit to the 2 parts cactus potting mix to encourage drainage and air circulation.",
    "rePotting": "Conophytums do not need to be repotted regularly for a size upgrade although changing the potting mix is advised every 2 years to keep the growing medium in good condition. The best time to repot is after the end of the rest period - late July - August. I would use clay pots that enable moisture to evaporate easily from the soil.",
    "fertilizer": "The Conophytum ficiforme is not fertilized throughout the growing season like many indoor plants. This is because damage may be caused to the plant tissue and further cause rot. If you decide to try and provide them some nutrients with a little feed do this only once or twice (one month and then the following month) at the beginning of the winter growing period with a cactus or succulent diluted fertilizer (10/10/10). The fertilizer can be added to a water mister.",
    "humidity": "Natural air humidity found in temperate regions seems to be fine for this Conophytum to grow. Plenty of air circulation is required when humidity is high or the air is dry.",
    "propagation": "Propagation methods includes taking cuttings or sowing seeds. Growing from seeds takes time for the plant to mature but they're not hard to grow from seed. Keeping temperatures consistent at around 21°C is ideal for seed germination. If your plant has a good clump of leaves and stems you can take cuttings and propagate, between Oct - Nov is best."

When it's winter growing slows down or stops, reduce watering and you can allow the top soil to become slightly dry between each watering. If you can - use tepid rain or distilled water and avoid cold hard water.",
    "soil": "A peat based potting mix will be required. 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite is one mixture that will be fine.",
    "fertilizer": "Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer every two weeks from April - October.",
    "rePotting": "You'll need to re-pot once every two years, during spring",
    "humidity": "This is one of the conditions which can be difficult to get right in many households and to maintain throughout the whole year for this plant. Misting and keeping the soil moist will help, but if you can and if your plant is showing signs that it's needed - use a humidity tray or electronic humidifier. Placing the Calathea near other plants will also improve humidity.",
    "propagation": "Propagation is done by dividing the main plant when re-potting is carried out. Provide a warm environment and enough humidity after dividing and replanting."

    "description": "In South America and other warm climates the pachira is grown for it's edible nuts, in east Asia for good fortune, and in Europe and the US for their attractiveness as an indoor tree species. Grown braided as a house plant edible nuts will not fruit.These have been cultivated in Taiwan to produce the braided types in various sizes including successful bonsai’s, which are exported to Europe, US and other countries.",
    "temperature": "Room temperatures from 65-75ºF (18-24ºC) are suitable, and no lower than 50ºF (10ºC).",
    "light": "Try your best to provide the plant with as much light as possible - without direct sunlight which can scorch the leaves. During the winter the amount of daylight time decreases, which will naturally tell the plant it's time to rest and slow it's growth down, so do not become concerned about it no longer producing new shoots and leaves.",
    "watering": "Thoroughly water the plant once the soil becomes dry and remove excess water from the pot tray. During the winter the pachira will slow it's growth right down and will not need to be watered anywhere near as much like in spring and summer. Do not over-water or have the plant in a pot which can become waterlogged.",
    "soil": "A peat moss based mix is suitable. A good mix can be made with 2 parts peat and one part perlite or sand (for drainage).",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot once every two years, during spring. The pachira wont need a pot much bigger than the one it resides in now, if it's grown more, otherwise the same pot will be fine. Keeping the tree small requires the plant to stay in a small pot with only a soil change.",
    "fertilizer": "A balanced liquid fertilizer diluted should be fed to the plant every 2 weeks which will encourage growth and healthy leaves. Feed from spring and stop just before winter or when growth really slows down, whichever comes first.",
    "humidity": "Above average room humidity is the best growing conditions to grow a money plant. During the summer increase levels with a humidity tray (tray with pebbles and water which the plants sits on) or a humidifier. During the winter avoid the plant becoming affected by dry air from artificial heating.",
    "propagation": "Propagate using 5 - 7 inch long stem tip cutting with at-least one node and only 1 or 2 sets of leaves. Use rooting hormone on the cut and re-pot in moist potting mix. For best results try and provide temperatures of 75 - 80บF (24บC - 27บC) and increase humidity. Don’t move the cutting from the pot until you see plenty of new growth, which could take 6 weeks or so (depending on the conditions it's growing in).",
    "pruning": "You can prune the tree down to the size you find suitable if the foliage becomes overgrown. Leave half inch of stem above a node and petiole with a leaf attached when cutting a stem."

    "description": "Dieffenbachia amoena is a very popular house plant due to its easy going nature. Plants that receive too little light or too little water will simply not grow as quickly as plants that are given proper care.This native to the West Indies will flower in the right conditions, but these flowers are unimpressive. The beauty of the dumb cane plant comes from the unique pattern found on every leaf.",
    "temperature": "Dieffenbachia amoena grows best when the temperature it is exposed to is between 65-75 ºF (18-23 ºC). Outside of this temperature zone, growth will continue at a greatly reduced rate, with tolerance extremes ranging from 40-90 ºF (4-35 ºC) Beyond these extremes, the plant will stop growing and may die with prolonged exposure.",
    "light": "This plant prefers bright, indirect sun light for the optimal growth. It will accept lighting conditions up to full shade and continue stunted growth. Full sun will burn the leaves.",
    "watering": "For the best results, keep the dumb cane plant's top inch of soil moist at all times. It will tolerate extended periods of watering neglect, but the leaves will begin to shrivel. Watering makes the leaves stiffen. Before moving the plant, allow the soil to dry out. This will give the leaves a more rubbery texture which will better survive the handling process.",
    "soil": "This plant is not picky about its soil conditions. It will grow in almost any soil mix except sand and orchid mixtures. For best results, a one to one mixture of potting soil and perlite should be used.",
    "rePotting": "This plant needs to have its root density checked annually in the spring. If the roots are becoming dense, re-pot into a size bigger pot. Reduce watering for a week before transplant.",
    "fertilizer": "To encourage your plant to grow faster, you may introduce a full strength mixture of standard, balanced fertilizer once a month. Over-fertilization will cause the plant to start dropping leaves.",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is fine.",
    "propagation": "This plant propagates best from new growth cuttings or from breaking away young stems that grow on the side of the plant. Place these sideways in moist sand until roots begin to show, then transfer upright to soil."

It has been known to bloom tiny flowers near the base of the foliage, although this seems to be a very rare occasion for growers - so its mainly grown for its foliage.",
    "temperature": "Average warmth is fine of approximately 60-75°F (15-24°C) and no lower than 45°F (8°C). They will tolerate much lower temperatures.",
    "light": "A brightly lit room is good but not essential. They're fine with low levels of light, but it's best to keep them out of direct sunlight which will damage the leaves.",
    "watering": "Water once the top one inch of soil becomes dry. Water less during winter and do not over water. Over watering to the degree that the soil becomes soggy for a period of time - can cause the plant to die. The Aspidistra elatior is drought tolerant so if it misses being watered even for a month it will look unwell but be right back with you once care and water is given again.",

    "description": "While this epiphyte plant - which is native to the rainforests in south America is a flowering plant, it's primarily grown indoors for its attractive foliage and the height it grows up to. It's a plant that becomes a focal point of a room once it matures.The holes and cuts within the leaves are said to form so the plant survives well within it's natural rain forest habitat when strong winds and heavy downpours (I mean very heavy) appear. Leaves without these cuts and holes would get broken easily because of their size and the force of the weather conditions.The Swiss cheese plant is fairly easy to care for and maintain, however, if the right conditions and care instructions are not followed the plant leaves can look very unattractive (see plant problems below).",
    "temperature": "Temperatures between 65-80ºF (18-27ºC) are ideal. Lower than 65ºF (18Cº) will slow down this plants growth and below 50ºF (10ºC) will stop growth.",
    "light": "A fairly bright room or bright with plenty of shade is best. Direct sunlight will damage the leaves and not enough light can slow growth down.",
    "watering": "Between watering times allow the soil to become dry to the touch within the top couple of inches or so of soil.",

    "humidity": "Average to high room humidity is needed, so you will need to increase the humidity of a normal room. Misting the leaves is helpful.",
    "propagation": "Propagate from a mature stem tip cuttings during summer below an aerial root at the node. Place the stem cutting about 1 or 2 inches deep in moist potting soil and water moderately. It should begin rooting within the first couple of weeks or so.",
    "pruning": "This plant can easily get out of hand once it has been growing for over 3 years or so and will need cutting back. The ideal method is to cut as many stems as needed away (these can be replanted) at the nodes during spring."
