    "temperature": "Temperatures averaging 70°F/21°C - 80°F/26°C are very good and not much below 50°F/10°C",
    "light": "The A.Vera thrives on bright light conditions, but not direct sunlight. Heat is fine because they react similar to a cacti in hot conditions. Bright rather than light (direct), is the key",
    "watering": "These are succulents which are mainly made up of water and retain a lot of water in it's foliage (for storage), similar to a cactus. The soil needs to be moist which is easy to check by placing a finger an inch deep into the soil to make sure it is not dry. It needs much less in the winter.",
    "soil": "A pot mixture used for cactus will suffice or a soil mix that drains well and is well aerated.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot when the plant has outgrown it's pot. It's best to re-pot the offsets (small aloes - pups) in separate pots once they have grown enough.",
    "fertilizer": "",
    "humidity": "Humidity is not a major concern for these, making the average room indoors sufficient.",
    "propagation": "Aloe offsets can be divided carefully and then re-potted. Pups will grow from the parent plant which are best removed when they are about 2 inches long, or when the main plant needs more room to grow. Leaf cuttings can also be taken and re-planted, although this method is not as successful. I would let cuttings dry out for at-least a few days before placing them in soil mix. Drying out allows time for the wound to heal and improve it's chance of growing."

    "temperature": "Average room temperature’s are fine. Avoid lower than 55°F/12°C in the winter.",
    "light": "As mentioned above they like light, however, direct sunshine can damage plant leaves. A mixture of light and shade is great, if you can provide it. If you see the leaves yellowing this could be caused by too much sunlight.",
    "watering": "This plant does drink a lot of water in the summer. Keeping the soil moist (not over watered) and allowing it to dry slightly near the top is a good idea.

    "watering": "It's best to allow the soil to become dry between each watering which will depend on the time of year, how much humidity and amount of sunlight it's getting. Allowing too much water to sit at the bottom of the pot with the roots will cause them to rot (avoid this).",
    "soil": "A good draining soil mix that is gritty is advisable to use, which is sold and used for cacti and succulents.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot (spring - summer) when the plant becomes root bound or the soil needs renewing. A good solid and heavy pot is best to use because Jade plants are well known for being top heavy. A heavy pot will prevent them from tipping over.",

There are a fair few types including standard, trailers, miniatures, and chimeras (a basic way to put them into a category). Various species includes different sizes, flower colors and foliage types. A grower needs to understand which type they have if they plan to propagate them - the procedure is different (for the Chimera). There are actually thousands of hybrids with various flower colors/forms and leaf types available.",
    "temperature": "Room temperatures of around 65°f / 16°c --- 75°f / 24°c are ideal. Try not to allow temperatures to decrease lower than 60°f / 15.5°c and it's advised to avoid cold drafts or abrupt temperature changes.",
    "light": "The African violet thrives in bright light, although too much direct sunlight will cause leaf problems (edges turn yellow, patches, or develop holes). I have grown mine, at best - close to east facing windows, but many other people grow them close to the south facing side. Growers will use artificial lighting to encourage blooms during winter time, using fluorescent lighting tubes. However, many of us do not want to use lighting and have the expense when we are happy enough to see the spring and summer blooms.",
    "watering": "A big mistake is to over water these or even water them with very cold water. Very cold water prevents growth, causes leaf spots and may cause a change in color. It's best to water them once the soil becomes slightly dry to the touch and water from the top or bottom. Any excess water at the bottom of a pot tray should be removed.",
    "soil": "A fast draining soil mix is best to use. I actually use the African V soil mix with 1 part vermiculite because it's cheap enough and easy to find in many stores.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot when needed (room temperature not below 70°F./21°C). I would always do this at least once every year, or even twice a year. There is no need to increase the pot size, unless it becomes pot bound or has grown larger.",
    "fertilizer": "Fertilize every couple of weeks with a balanced fertilizer that's urea-free. Or even better, a solution specifically for A.violets.",
    "humidity": "These need high humidity and plenty of gentle misting (with luke warm water, not in direct sunlight and only the leaves) for healthy growth and to flower well. You can use a humidity tray to support the correct levels that needs to have small pebbles or a layer of gravel at the bottom with water added below the surface.",

With large arching branches and long pointed leaves, it looks attractive indoors (apart from leaves dropping). The Benjamina is one of the most popular small indoor trees from this genus that grows quite slowly and needs a grower to take particular care of a few needs (lighting, watering, etc.), which is fairly easy, when you know how.",
    "temperature": "Room temperatures of around 65°f / 16°c --- 75°f / 24°c is ideal. Try not to allow temperatures to decrease lower than 50°f / 10°c, although they can handle a bit lower, without problems.",
    "light": "Bright light is what keeps the weeping fig happy, that is partially shaded. A spot that receives some sun and shade during the day is great. As mentioned previously do not move the tree, not even turning it around to prevent leaves being shed.",
    "watering": "Allow the compost to dry to a certain extent (at the top) between each watering with tepid filtered or distilled water. Over-watering and under-watering can cause the leaves to drop. To identify the problem check if the leaves are crispy or if they fold easily. If they fold then the problem could be over-watering, and if crispy the tree could be under watered. Add enough water that can seep from the top soil to the drainage holes, at the bottom of the container and remove the left over water to allow enough oxygen to the plant roots. Less watering in the winter is to be carried out.",
    "soil": "A fast draining soil-less mix is advised.",

Native to South America, the Peperomia obtusifolia is a perennial flowering epiphyte plant species. In its natural habitat it grows within high humidity forest areas making use of the nutrients provided from tree debris and the natural tropical environment. There are a number of cultivars including the dark green leaved, variegated and the Peperomia obtusifolia 'Albomarginata' that displays yellowy gold and green patched leaves.",
    "temperature": "Ideal temperatures of 65-75ºF (18-24ºC), and no lower than 50ºF (10ºC).",
    "light": "Bright light and for the variegated types some direct sunlight (couple of hours) can help them grow well. If the leaves are dark green in color it's best not to provide direct sun as it will harm them, but the variegated types may lose variegation if enough light is not provided. South, east or west facing windows are best suited, but again dependent on the leaf color.",
    "watering": "The baby rubber plant is fairly easy to water. Allow the top soil to dry out completely and then water thoroughly. You do not want to over water this plant and allow the soil to become waterlogged....so it might be best to lean towards less rather than too much when you first start growing Peperomias, as less harm can be caused compared to overwatering. During winter water sparingly as the thick leaves will store water, so don't get too concerned about the soil being dry.",
    "soil": "A peat based soil is best used that drains well. 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite or sand is a good mix. Other mixes will work well, but the main point is for the medium to drain well and be well aerated.",
    "rePotting": "You will not need to repot or pot up a size very often as this plant has a small root system. It's a good idea to change the soil or at least the top soil annually and if a young plant has out grown its current pot you may repot a size up during spring. Better to lean towards a smaller pot than a pot too large to prevent the soil becoming waterlogged. Shallow pots are a good option for Peperomias.",
    "fertilizer": "During spring - while the plant is growing use a diluted liquid fertilizer once every 2 weeks, and once a month during summer. No feeding is required from autumn to spring",
    "humidity": "This species does like a humid environment. During the warmer months you can mist the leaves and/or place the plant on a pebble tray with water at the bottom. Most homes should be fine with its natural humidity if the air is not dry.",
    "propagation": "An easy method to propagate is to take a few centimeters of stem tip cuttings. Remove a tip (petiole) with about 5 - 8 cm of tip with one or two leaves on it. Plant the cutting in a very small pot with fresh potting mix that's moist and try to provide warm temperatures of about 20ºC (68ºF), and plenty of bright light (warmth and light is the key to success). You may want to use a rooting hormone on the cut being planted. The baby rubber plant can also propagate with leaf cuttings, although variegated types may lose the variegation. You may want to experiment and try a few leaves and stem tips to see what propagation method works best for you. I would allow leaves or stem tip cuttings a day to dry out until planted. Wait for new growth and be careful not to overwater the move a pot size up once plenty of growth has happened."

They are known as the slipper orchid and can grow to a height of around 15-30 cm. They form part of a group known as terrestrial orchids which means that they grow in the ground but unlike other terrestrial orchids they do not produce pseudobulbs which are found at the base of the stems. The Paphiopedilum are also split into two cultural groups. The first is the warm-growing group that has mottled like leaves which are great for beginners and the second group is the cool-growing group that has plain-green leaves.",

The cool group prefer daytime temperatures of around 65-70ºF (18-21ºC) and night time temperatures of around 55-62ºF (12.5-16.5ºC).",
    "light": "A diminished light is preferred by the paphiopedilum and a window that faces the east or west is ideal, however, a south facing window is fine as long as the sunlight is not directly hitting the plant.",
    "watering": "It is vital to water the Paphiopedium in the morning as this allows the water to evaporate from the foliage throughout the day which helps to prevent problems such as bacteria and fungus rot.

    "description": "Native to South Africa this species is a perennial in warmer climates but in cooler countries (temperate regions) it's grown as an annual and flowering pot plant. There are many varieties and hybrids sold that are more compact in growth than the basic type. The basic type has stalks which grow up to 2ft tall that can become quite lanky and unattractive. The attractive bright colored flowers has made Gebera daisies an excellent bridal bouquet choice. For those that prefer to have them closer to their skin - they are also a popular floral tattoo choice.",
    "temperature": "Average temperatures of 55 - 75°F (13 - 24°C) are suitable.",
    "light": "A lover of direct sunlight and bright windowsills. Place close to a south, east or west facing window to provide enough sunlight.",
    "watering": "It's best to keep the soil moist at all times. Once the soil becomes slightly dry to the touch provide water straight away or the plant will begin to wilt very quickly.",
    "soil": "A peat based potting mix with 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite is suggested.",
    "rePotting": "",
    "fertilizer": "While flowering, feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks.",
    "humidity": "Gerbera's quite like above average humidity levels, although average is absolutely fine.",
    "propagation": "These are mostly propagated with seeds although the parent plant can also be divided or root cuttings can be used."

    "description": "The flamingo flower plant is a species from the Anthuirum genus that displays great looking waxed effect flowers which bloom with an orange curly spadix. The Anthurium scherzerianum from the genus is suitable for a room within a home because of the acceptable height it grows up to, and of course the attractive spathe it displays for décor purposes.",
    "temperature": "Average room temperatures from 65°F/18.3°C - 75°F/23.8°C (maybe a little higher and not below 60°F/15.5°C). Lower temperatures will affect it's leaves (may turn yellow), impede it's growth and flowering.",
    "light": "The flamingo flower is a lover of light - but not direct sunlight.",
    "watering": "Keeping the soil moist at all times within the summer is advisable. Water every couple of days and less in the winter.",
    "soil": "A good draining soil is best suited, such as a peat moss based potting soil and perlite.",
    "rePotting": "These are re-potted within spring usually every 2 years, or when they become pot-bound.",
    "fertilizer": "",
    "humidity": "The flamingo loves being misted with a light spray of lukewarm water, regulary. Cleaning lightly with a gentle sponge is advised, which improves humidity - and makes it look healthy.",
    "propagation": "Propagate by dividing the plant when you decide to re-pot in spring. Having a good temperature above 75°F/23.8°C for the first few weeks will give the plant a great start in life."

    "description": "Moth orchid is the common name for the phalaenopsis orchid that's quickly become one of the most popular species from the orchidaceae family of flowering plants. Glorious colored blooms all year round and the "ease of growing" is what makes these a popular house plant choice.",
    "temperature": "Phals like their warmth during the day and cool during the night. Room temperatures of around 65 - 85°F (16 - 24°C) during the day and 60 - 65°F ( 16 - 18°C) at night, are ideal growing conditions.",
    "light": "Providing enough light can be a problem for some growers because the moth orchid prefers bright light conditions for more than 10 hours a day. An east or west facing window is best suited - away from direct sun, but bright. During the winter you may have to supplement the plant with artificial lighting.",
    "watering": "Once the orchid soil becomes dry to the touch, water thoroughly. Avoid allowing water to keep the soil soaked; you want it to drain away easily. Avoid watering the middle of the plants foliage (crown) because the water sitting here for a period of time may cause rot. Do not over-water!",
    "soil": "Using an orchid potting mix is a good idea. A mix is likely to contain peat moss, perlite and fir bark or another combination, if it drains well. This soil needs to replaced every two years.",
    "rePotting": "The potting mix used for phals needs to be changed at least once every 2 years, during spring. The potting mix will start to become a problem for the plant when it becomes old and deteriorates. I would re-pot in a pot similar to the size of the roots and pot it's already growing in, then remove unsavoury roots whilst re-potting. The roots that were sitting on the top of the soil need to be placed back in that position and not buried.",
    "fertilizer": "Feed from spring until fall with a diluted orchid liquid fertilizer, once every 1 - 2 weeks.",
    "humidity": "Avoid placing your plant in a room with dry air from artificial heating without supplementing humidity levels from a humidity tray (or other means). Orchids in their natural habitat thrive in high humidity conditions. Mist the leaves.",
    "propagation": "The orchid can be propagated by division, which is a good idea when the plants roots have matured. Divide the mature plant during re-potting time. Another method is called keiki which is a baby plant produced by the mother plant growing from the node. Some growers will use a keiki hormone paste to encourage and force the mother plant to produce a baby plant."
