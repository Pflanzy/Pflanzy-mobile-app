    "description": "Amaryllis hippeastrum are bulb flowering type plants that produce a cluster of attractive trumpet like flowers in different color variation. Some confusion over the years has occurred between the hippeastrum and amaryllis when both are actually a separate genus.",
    "temperature": "The amaryllis within the growing period (winter - spring) prefers temperatures of 70 - 75F°f (21 - 24°c) and from September - November (or early December) 55°f (13°c). After the plant as flowered the temperature can be kept at around 70 - 75F°f (21 - 24°c) which will keep the flower healthier longer.",
    "light": "Bright light without too much direct sunlight is preferable.",
    "watering": "During the growing and flowering period, water when the top inch of the soil becomes dry. Once the leaves are cut away you can stop watering for about 8 – 10 weeks (dormant period) or water sparingly until new growth appears. When new leaves appear water frequently again when the top inch of soil becomes dry. Overwatering may cause the bulb to rot.",
    "soil": "You can use equal part perlite and peat or two parts loam soil and one part perlite. Your local garden store will offer other suitable options as well.",
    "rePotting": "Your hippeastrum can be re-potted if the bulb seems to have outgrown the pot or every 2 years just before the dormant growing period (Nov - Dec). The pot size needs to be approximatively 2 inches wider each side of the bulb.",
    "fertilizer": "After the dormant period (Nov -Dec) begin feeding with a liquid fertilizer once every 2 weeks once you begin to see leaf shoots appearing. Continue until the leaves are cut down ready for the dormant period (Sept - Nov).",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is fine.",
    "propagation": "These can be propagated by seed (takes up to 5 years to mature and flower) or bulb offsets. Propagating with offsets takes about half the time to produce a mature plant that flowers compared to planting seeds (about 3 years)."

    "temperature": "The Beach Spider Lily is capable of withstanding temperatures that drop into the 40ºF (4°C) range, and as high as 90ºF (32ºC). They must be protected against frosts by all means, or the plant will die back to the bulb stage.",
    "light": "This plant requires partial shade to full sun. Make certain it can get enough light from the pot location.",
    "watering": "Hymenocallis littoralis demands wet conditions all year long. The bulbs can be started in nothing except water, but need to be moved to soil once they begin to sprout. Soil should be kept moist, but never soggy. Do not allow standing water in the saucer underneath.",
    "soil": "These plants prefer a standard potting soil mixed with bark or pumice at a 1:1 ratio. The pH of the soil chosen needs to be between 5.0 and 7.5 for the continued health of the plant.",
    "rePotting": "Every two years, this plant requires re-potting and an infusion of new soil. Move the plant to a size larger pot, and mix in new soil to fill the gaps. This should be done when the plant is not flowering.",
    "fertilizer": "You may fertilize your plant once every two weeks with a diluted balanced fertilizer. Seaweed based fertilizers have been reported to produce the best results.",
    "humidity": "This plant is happy with normal air humidity, as long as its soil is properly moist. If the soil has been allowed to dry out, the leaves and flowers may be misted with a spray bottle to combat dehydration effects.",
    "propagation": "This plant is propagated either by seed or by dividing rhizomes. Maturity from seed takes several years. It is easier to break off a piece of the bulb and propagate from it."

Keeping this rhizome happy indoors is a matter of paying attention to some very basic growing conditions. The Zantedeschia aethiopica is native to southern Africa. As such, this plant is used to very different growing conditions than are found naturally in other parts of the world.",
    "temperature": "These flowers can be rather picky about their temperatures. For ideal growing conditions expose the bulbs to days no hotter than 65°F and no colder than 55°F. The above ground plant can tolerate temperatures as high as 75°F. If your home is hot, use mulch to keep the bulb cooler in its pot.",
    "light": "This plant requires plenty of bright sunlight during non-peak hours of the day. Provide it with a sunny window facing east or west for best results.",
    "watering": "Zantedeschia aethiopica is a water loving plant. It grows best on the edges of ponds and in the mud. Because of this, your indoor lily will prefer moist conditions. Keep the soil always moist, but never allow water to sit in the container. Too much water will cause the bulb to rot.",
    "soil": "Standard potting soil is a good mixture for this plant. Avoid potting soils with an unbalanced pH or too much fertilizer mixed in.",
    "rePotting": "This plant takes to re-potting well. Simply dig the plant out of the soil, including the entire bulb. Replant the bulb with the shoots pointing up at least three inches deep in the soil. Cover, and water once. Wait until new growth is evident before watering again.",
    "fertilizer": "The Calla Lily normally doesn't need fertilizer. If you desire better growth, use a fertilizer with no ammonium in it. Use this in a mixture of 1 part fertilizer to 1 gallon of water, and fertilize once every two weeks for a single season only. Continued fertilization for long periods of time will harm the plant.",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is acceptable for this plant, as long as the soil is kept moist. This is especially true during winter.",
    "propagation": "If the Calla Lily is fertilized, small black berries will form. These can be dried out and planted in three inches of potting soil. This will form new bulbs. Otherwise, you can dig up the rhizome and break off a section of it. Permit this to dry for two days, then plant with the non-smooth side up and water according to re-potting instructions."

    "description": "The fiddle leaf fig from the ficus genus of trees is an exciting species to grow with larger leaves than the others from the genus. This indoor tree type plant grows over 15 metres tall in it's natural habitat and up to 3 metres indoors, although they can be topped to prevent them growing taller. When these plants mature in age and size they make a great focal point within living rooms, hallways, offices or hotels.",
    "temperature": "Temperature:Temperatures between 60 - 75°F (15 - 24°C are suitable. Avoid lower than 55°F (12°C).",
    "light": "A brightly lit spot is needed without direct sunlight, although a small amount of daily sun is good (not mid afternoon sun).",
    "watering": "Water when the top soil becomes slightly dry and reduce watering in the winter. The worst thing to do is to over water (not underwater) because lack of water is easily fixed, unlike the damage from over-watering.",
    "soil": "A good draining potting soil is needed which could include part bark and perlite.",
    "rePotting": "When the plant is young and growing re-pot it every spring. Once it matures you'll only need to replace the top soil each year.",
    "fertilizer": "The ficus lyata does not have a strong need for fertilizer like some other ficus trees have. During the spring and summer I would provide the plant with a feed of diluted liquid fertilizer once a month.",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is fine, but increase the humidity during the winter if artificial heating is used within the room.",
    "propagation": "It's advisable for the average indoor grower to not propagate these because they're difficult, although it's worth trying. If you try you will need to take stem tip cuttings, add rooting hormone to the cut and replant them. Once planted use bottom heat to improve your chance of success. Air layering is also a method used to propagate these, which is more successful but difficult for most indoor growers."

During the winter the amount of daylight time decreases, which will naturally tell the plant it's time to rest and slow it's growth down, so do not become concerned about it no longer producing new shoots and leaves.",
    "watering": "Thoroughly water the plant once the soil becomes dry and remove excess water from the pot tray.

    "fertilizer": "Feeding with a liquid diluted fertilizer from May - September is ideal, once every 4 weeks. They can also be mist sprayed with a foliar fertilizer to provide the foliage with nutrients.",
    "humidity": "Normal humidity indoors should be fine, and misting of the plant leaves will help too.",
    "propagation": "These are easily propagated after the offsets have grown over 5 inches tall, and a few months old. They need to be separated from the container they have been growing inside with roots attached and then placed into a suitable sized container with a moist soil mix."

    "description": "This low growing plant spreads out to cover the ground it is provided with, offering a visually unique presentation to growers. With its picky watering and light demands, the coral bead plant has proven difficult for the beginner house plant growers.",
    "temperature": "Nertera granadensis prefers temperatures on the cooler side. The plant should remain at 55-65ºF (13-18ºC) all year round. Occasional temperature spikes as high as 80ºF (26ºC) and low as 40ºF (4ºC) are tolerated, but must be remedied within a week for the plant's health. Temperatures above 65ºF (18ºC) during flowering will result in no berries produced during that season.",
    "light": "This plant demands a source of light that is bright, yet indirect, in order to maintain its health.",
    "watering": "Requires different watering demands depending upon the time of year that you are in. During the spring and summer, this plant should be kept moist at all times. Soil should be watered whenever it begins to feel dry, but never kept soggy. During summer months, the plant should remain on a saucer of wet pebbles to offer the increased moisture demanded. In autumn and winter, the plant's soil should be permitted to dry almost completely before watering again.",
    "soil": "This plant possesses a shallow root system. As such, the pot does not need to be more than a few inches deep. One part potting mix to one part perlite or tree bark is the preferred soil choice.",
    "rePotting": "When needed, the coral bead plant should be re-potted in the spring season only. It will remain confined within its available space happily for its entire life, so re-potting is only needed if you desire a larger plant.",
    "fertilizer": "A balanced fertilizer, diluted to one-half strength, should be applied to the plant in a misting fashion once a month throughout the year. Do not pour the fertilizer directly onto the soil, as it will sink beyond reach of the shallow root system.",
    "humidity": "During spring and summer months, this plant requires daily misting of the flowers and berries. In autumn and winter, occasional misting is needed on a weekly basis.",
    "propagation": "For Nertera granadensis, propagation is best achieved by division. In the spring, pull a clump of the plant away from the mother plant and pot it its own location. Seed and tip cuttings are other propagation methods, but require years to reach maturity."

    "description": "I've added the Amazon elephant's ear plant to the unusual plant section because of it's distinct dark green leaves with whitish colored veins that are quite unique. This species that's native to tropical Southeast Asia will let a grower know about it when requesting how much warmth, humidity and water it requires.",
    "temperature": "Told you that you was going to need to keep this plant warm. Ideal temperatures should be approximately 65-75ºF + (18-24ºC +)...closer to 70ºF is best.",
    "light": "Bright light, but no direct sunlight and shaded for a good part of the day in the summer, if it's warm and humid enough.",
    "watering": "Water a little but often - keeping the soil moist at all times. Water much less during winter.",
    "soil": "Use a fast draining peat based potting mix.",
    "rePotting": "These can be re-potted every spring but only use a pot one size bigger if it's become very root bound.",
    "fertilizer": "Feed with a diluted balanced fertilizer from spring every 2 weeks and stop at the end of August then start again at the beginning of spring.",
    "humidity": "These plants like slightly higher humidity levels than many other plants. You may need to raise the humidity levels in a room artificially by placing the plant in a humidity tray with pebbles or use a humidifier.",
    "propagation": "These are usually propagated by dividing the plant when it's being re-potted in spring."

    "description": "The Venus Fly Trap is one of the plant species that consumes prey in order to nourish itself. Each plant contains four to seven traps, and produces white flowers when permitted to bloom.",
    "temperature": "These plants are happiest between 60°- 90°F (15°- 32°C) for most of the year. During the winter months, they enter a dormancy period, and can withstand temperatures as low as 30°F (-1°C) for short periods of time.",
    "light": "Dionaea Muscipula is a light demanding plant. For optimal health conditions, it requires at least 12 hours of light a day. At least 4 of those should be full sunlight.",
    "watering": "They like their growing medium to be kept moist at all times, but never to the point of soggy. They are best watered through bottom-watering systems (water tray). Water should always be distilled before providing to the plant, as the chemicals in typical tap water are poisonous to the root system.",
    "soil": "This plant demands nutrient poor soil. Peat moss and long fiber sphagnum moss should be mixed in a 1:1 ratio for the best growing conditions.",
    "rePotting": "These plants can be re-potted at any time other than their dormancy period.",
    "fertilizer": "Never introduce fertilizer to your plant. These cause the root system to rot.",
    "humidity": "Normal household humidity is suggested.",
    "propagation": "Growing these plants from seeds requires at least five years before maturity is reached. Propagation from splitting existing plants is more common."
