    "description": "This cacti is an epiphytic plant which means within it's natural habitat it grows on another plant (tree), for support. The rat's tail cactus is a plant that is fairly easy to care for and maintain, which enjoys it's matured life being housed within a hanging basket or container.",
    "temperature": "Temperatures averaging 50°F/10°C - 75°F/23.8°C are ideal but not below 40°F/5°C and avoid frost.",
    "light": "The rat tail cactus thrives on bright light, but not direct sunlight. It also enjoys the warmth of the summer sun while it sits within a shaded area. Some sunlight and shade is great.",
    "watering": "It's advisable to water this plant frequently within the summer and much less winter time. Add water at the top of the pot or container and allow it to seep through to the drainage holes, then remove the excess water from the pot tray. Keeping the soil slightly moist is also advisable within the summer.",
    "soil": "A pot mixture used for cactus plants will suffice.",
    "rePotting": "Re-potting every 2 -3 years is advised and when it becomes pot bound. Remember the spines can be prickly so you may want to wear protective gloves while re-potting.",
    "fertilizer": "",
    "humidity": "Humidity does not seem to be a major concern for the Disocactus flagelliformis, making the average indoor environment fine - as it is.",
    "propagation": "These are propagated by stem cuttings early summer. When they are cut - you will find - letting them dry for a few days helps the process, because the wounds can heal."

    "description": "This Cereus (Genus) cacti can produce white flowers within summer - that open up at night, once it matures and a prominent ribbed column stem, with brown colored spines, is displayed. But there are a few varieties which get confused with this cacti, because they have similarities and grow with a column stem. For example, the difference between the C.peruvinus and C.jamacara cactus is the, spines (C.P brown - C.J yellow) and flowers (C.P are longer). ",
    "temperature": "Temperatures averaging 60°F/°15.5C - 75°F/23.8°C is ideal from spring to fall and a cooler 50°F/10°C – 55°F/13°, after this period.",
    "light": "The Peruvian apple cactus thrives on bright light and sun light, although direct sun when blazing hot is best avoided, when first introduced to direct sun.",
    "watering": "It's advisable to water this plant more often within the summer and much less, winter time. Like other desert type cacti their natural habitat is dry and they store water within the stems. Water this plant when the soil begins drying out, throughout spring and late summer. In late summer reduce watering until the next spring and allow the soil to be fairly dry.",
    "soil": "A fast draining pot mixture used for cactus plants is ideal.",
    "rePotting": "While they're young they can be re-potted each year in spring. Once they mature re-pot only when necessary, with a slightly larger pot.",
    "fertilizer": "",
    "humidity": "No misting is required. A well ventilated room during the summer is preferable.",
    "propagation": "This cacti is propagated with cuttings from the stem top (especially when it's growing too high), or offsets during spring or summer. They can also be propagated with seeds at temperatures from 70°F/°21C - 80°F/26.6°C, although this method is much more difficult than propagating cuttings. When using cuttings, allow the cutting a week or two to dry before planting in a peat based compost."

    "description": "The Bunny cacti is native to northern Mexico and desert regions stretching into Arizona. This plant has the appearance of a shrub, and spreads out to cover between 2-5 feet of ground as a mature plant. Named for its visual appearance, the spines of the Bunny Ear Cactus, come off with a simple touch, and are best removed from flesh with tweezers.",
    "temperature": "This cactus enjoys temperatures ranging from 70-100°F (21-37°C), but demands cooler temperatures during the winter months. Starting in the late fall, this cactus should be kept between 50-65°F (10-18°C), and away from central heating vents. The cooler spell is demanded over the course of the entire winter, during which time the segments of cactus will turn a light gray color. Failure to provide these controlled winter conditions will result in plant death the following spring.",
    "light": "Demands full light growing for most of the year, except during the winter cycle. For the plant's health, light should be reduced to partial sun during this time.",
    "watering": "The Polka-dot Cactus is a desert species. It should be given water on a regular basis during its first season in a new pot. This will help it to create a strong root system. The soil should be kept moist, but not soggy. After the first season, more sporadic watering is required. During the winter cycle, the cactus should not be watered at all, with watering to resume in the early spring.",
    "soil": "Like most cacti, this specimen demands sandy soil-bases that drain easily. It is usually happy with the pre-packaged cactus soil found in common hardware stores. To increase drainage for a picky plant, mix in a 1:1 ratio of perlite or bark.",
    "rePotting": "Re-potting should take place in the summer, after the year's bloom has finished. Remember to water the plant regularly to promote the growth of a healthy root system during its first year in the new pot.",
    "fertilizer": "Monthly feeding of low nitrogen fertilizer. Fertilization should stop one month before the planned winter cycle for the plant's health.",
    "humidity": "Prefers low humidity conditions. Consider running a dehumidifier in the room where the cactus lives to provide it with the most ideal conditions possible.",
    "propagation": "ny fully grown pad from this cactus may be broken off cleanly in the early summer and re-potted for propagation purposes. Cuttings work best when grouped in threes or more, and should be buried an inch deep in the soil. Remember to water regularly to promote the growth of a healthy root system in the first year after propagation."

    "description": "The Christmas Cactus possesses a scientific name which belongs to a genus that has a confusing history - to say the least. The plant currently belongs to the Schlumbergera genus, is native to South America that grows in the mountains of Brazil. It's tropical nature commonly confuses growers into offering too much heat and light, without enough water. This cactus requires a resting period that helps it to bloom again, from Feb - March. During this time keep temperatures at approximately 55°F (12.7°C) and water less. Pre - flowering period from Oct - Nov requires the plant soil to be kept fairly dry until flowers bud, and then resume normal watering and temperatures.",
    "temperature": "Temperature: Best kept at 68°F (20°C), although fluctuations from 60-70°F (15-21°C) are tolerated. The plant can be kept at 55-59°F (13-15°C) will grow slowly and allow rest. Plant death can occur at below 50°F (10°C).",
    "light": "During the late fall and all winter long these plants like full, direct sunlight. At any other time of the year, the plants should be grown in partial sun conditions. Too much light during non-flowering times will cause the plant to turn yellow and fail to produce buds in the coming year.",
    "watering": "Although a cactus, this is a tropical plant. The top inch of soil should be kept moist to the touch at all times. Never allow the soil to become water-logged, or permit water to stand in the pot tray.",
    "soil": "The Christmas Cactus likes being grown in pots. It demands an easily drained growth medium. Suggested is a mixture of 60% potting soil with a pH balanced formula and either 40% bark or 40% perlite.",
    "rePotting": "This is best performed in the late spring season. Place the cactus with plenty of room in the container. Re-potting is required every three years to provide additional growth room, although they do prefer being partially pot-bound.",
    "fertilizer": "They likewise require a high dose of magnesium in the soil for proper growth, which is achieved through a mixture of 1 teaspoon Epsom salts to 1 gallon of water. This must be delivered to the plant on a monthly basis from early spring through early fall, and should be given two weeks after a regular fertilizer treatment for best results",
    "humidity": "Normal room humidity is suggested for this plant. Mist leaves frequently.",
    "propagation": "Best propagated through the cutting method. Sections of stem tip's at least 3 segments long should be removed from the main plant. These must be left to dry for theree or four days. Combine the three cuttings and place at least one inch deep in soil. For best results, cuttings should be taken in early summer."

    "description": "This holiday cactus is so named because it blooms around the Easter holiday in the northern hemisphere.It will mostly care for itself once it is set up properly, although certain conditions are required for the Easter cactus to bloom the following year. A native of southeastern Brazil, Hatiora gaertneri is a tropical cactus that requires a certain amount of regular water in order to survive. The fully grown cactus resembles a shrub. In the wild, these cacti grow on trees or rocks only, so they require a special potting mixture to keep them healthy in your home.",
    "temperature": "Temperature: The tropical Hatiora gaertneri prefers spring, summer, and fall temperatures around 75-80°F (24-27°C). Winter temperatures should be between 45-6°5F (7-18°C) only.",
    "light": "This tropical cacti likes bright partial light only. It should never be exposed to full sunlight or midday sunlight.",
    "watering": "Soil should be kept constantly moist, but never soggy. Do not allow water to sit in the dish underneath.",
    "soil": "Due to its natural growing environment being on rocks or trees, this cactus requires rough soil to grow well. A 1:1 mixture of potting soil to pumice, tree bark, or perlite is required. Pumice is preferred.",
    "rePotting": "Never re-pot during the bloom or following resting period. Re-pot by removing only the loose soil around the roots. Transfer immediately to a size larger pot and pack in with appropriate soil.",
    "fertilizer": "The Easter cactus prefers fertilization every 14 days. Use a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer, and dilute to half strength. Do not fertilize during resting period.",
    "humidity": "Hatiora gaertneri requires a humid environment to survive. The plant should be misted with a sprayer daily, even during the rest period, to simulate the needed humidity.",
    "propagation": "Any segment at least 3 inches long can be used for propagation. Allow the cutting to harden for at least 48 hours. Plant the small end of the segment in shallow, moist perlite. Rooting occurs between 3-4 weeks."

    "description": "The Orchid cacti can be a picky customer, but when you treat it correctly, it will bring your home beauty for years to come. An Orchid cactus (forest type cacti) blooms multi-petalled bright funnel shaped flowers that spread out from 4 - 6 inches, and the foliage can get a little out of control. This is a tropical cactus, and will need to be watered frequently.In order to ensure blooms in the following year, these plants require a winter resting period. Beginning in December, move your orchid cactus into an unheated, dark room. Provide it with daylight during the normal hours the sun is up. Watering should be minimal during this time. Remove from resting room in early March or when buds form. This native of southern Mexico flourishes in the tropical environment. Despite the name cactus, it enjoys water. Natural growth periods are in the spring and fall only. Its scientific name has recently been changed to Disocactus ackermannii from the previous Epiphyllum ackermannii, rendering some amount of confusion in the botanical world.",
    "temperature": "Keep this cactus between 60-75ºF (16-24ºC) during its active cycle. During the resting period, daytime temperatures must be 60-65ºF (16-18ºC) and night-time temperatures must be 40-55ºF (4-12ºC).",
    "light": "These plants prefer their sunlight to be indirect or filtered. Do not expose to sunlight during the heat of the day. A healthy plant will show dark green growth with red edges if the right amount of light is being provided.",
    "watering": "The soil of Disocactus ackermannii must have careful attention paid to its moisture levels. The roots must never dry out, but the top 1/3 inch of soil should become dry between watering.",
    "soil": "Best mixture for this plant to thrive is 3 parts potting soil to 1 part pumice, bark chips, or perlite. Pumice is preferred.",
    "rePotting": "As the root system expands, your plant will need to be re-potted. Every 2 years, move the plant to a single size larger pot. Do not remove the soil from around the roots during transplant. Instead, shake the excess off, and fill in the gaps around the roots with new soil. Never re-pot within a month of blooming.",
    "fertilizer": "Once a week during the summer and fall months, offer your orchid cactus a balanced mixture of fertilizer such as 10-10-10, diluted to 1/4 teaspoon per gallon. In the spring, a blooming fertilizer such as 7-9-5 should be used. During the winter rest period, use the balanced fertilizer, but reduce feeding to once per month.",
    "humidity": "During the spring, summer, and fall, normal room humidity is tolerated. During the winter rest, humidity should be lowered with a dehumidifier in the resting room.",
    "propagation": "From seeds, this cactus takes 12-15 years to mature to the blooming stage. Propagation of a flowering plant takes one year, and is achieved by breaking off sections at least two leaf segments long. Permit the cuttings to harden for one week, then plant exactly two leaf serrations deep in soil. Water sparingly but regularly."

    "description": "The golden barrel cactus is a globe shaped type cacti suitable for growing in conservatories, on patios or any other type of indoor glass rooms. They are grown indoors inside conservatories or other glass rooms where enough sunlight is provided. However, they seem to have great difficulty flowering indoors.",
    "temperature": "Temperatures averaging 50°F/10°C - 75°F/23.8°C are ideal but not below 40°F/5°C and avoid frost.",
    "light": "Plenty of sunshine will keep this cacti more than happy. In a glass room you may have to provide some shade during a hot summers day to prevent sunburn.",
    "watering": "From spring until fall; water similar to many other house plants by watering when the soil begins drying. Before and during winter barely water the plant. Overwatering, especially when the temperature becomes cold can rot this species.",
    "soil": "A pot mixture used for cactus plants that drains well will suffice. Adding gravel or small pebbles at the bottom first few inches of the pot will encourage drainage.",
    "rePotting": "When they are young and growing it's best to re-pot these once a year; during spring in a slightly bigger container. Once they mature re-pot maybe every 2 - 3 years or when necessary.",
    "fertilizer": "Feed every 4 weeks with a high potassium fertilizer during summer.",
    "humidity": "Humidity does not seem to be a major concern for the Echinocactus grusonii, which makes the average indoor environment fine, as it is. Provide as much fresh air as you can , but not cold drafts.",
    "propagation": "These are propagated with seeds once it fruits after flowering."

It is quite an easy plant to grow and care for, which makes them suitable for those new to growing indoors. It takes time to grow to a full size plant. The amount of time may depend on its light conditions. They all need a few years regardless of conditions.",
    "temperature": "Average warmth 65°F (18°C) and above is fine and no less than 50°F (10°C) at night.",
    "light": "These are not demanding for the grower when it comes to providing enough light. Any shaded type room will suffice with indirect sunlight.",
    "watering": "Watering the parlor palm too much will cause growing problems and could possibly kill it off. My plant is now fully grown and has enjoyed just a small amount of watering once the soil starts to dry. Very little is needed in the winter. Making sure the roots have good drainage is something they like.",
    "soil": "Any decent potting mix will suffice (soil or soilless).",

    "description": "The Davallia fejeensis belongs to a genus of 40 plants that are epiphytic in nature, which means they grow on trees or within rock crevices taking moisture and nutrients from other sources (not soil) such as air, rain, trees and other debris. Over the years we have learnt to grow these within our western homes by imitating the plants natural habitat. We've learned how to grow a group of ferns for some time now and the Rabbit's foot is one that will grow well, (if the correct conditions are provided). Moisture and the right amount of light is the rule of thumb here.",
    "temperature": "Temperatures from 60-75ºF (15-24ºC) is advised. No lower than 55ºF (13ºC).",
    "light": "Provide indirect bright light - avoiding direct sunlight. Direct sunlight will scorch the leaves and turn the rhizomes brown, especially with low humidity levels. A small amount of sun (not midday sun) will not cause too much harm and can encourage plant health, but it's a bit risky with this fern.",
    "watering": "During spring and summer try and keep the soil moist at all times, without leaving the soil soaked. This species only has small roots so it's taking most of it's water and nutrients from the top soil and stroring them within it's rhizomes.",
    "soil": "A well draining potting soil that is peat based will suffice.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot within spring to a slightly larger pot in width - if the rhizomes and roots need more room. This is a good time to cut away rhizomes to propagate new plants. Don't plant the rhizomes in the soil!",
    "fertilizer": "From the beginning of spring until the end of fall use a diluted liquid feed once every 2 - 3 weeks.",
    "humidity": "I would increase the humidity in a room to keep the plant looking healthy. Misting will help but your likely to need to place the plant on a humidity tray or use a humidifier when the air is dry.",
    "propagation": "It propagates dividing 2 inch sections of a rhizome and include at least one stem with a frond. You will have to pin the rhizome within moist potting soil using strong wire or toothpicks. Once you see new growth, new plants are growing."

    "watering": "Having good drainage from the pot is important to prevent root rot. Checking the top soil for moisture (by touch) is the best way to see if they need water. If the top soil is dry in the summer--give him a drink, and in the winter I would advise you to water it less, and allow some dryness.",

The polka dot cactus (other common name) is fairly easy to grow if a grower can provide enough bright light, no over-watering, provide it's winter resting period and average room temperatures. Simple!",
    "temperature": "This cactus enjoys temperatures ranging from 70-100°F (21-37°C), but demands cooler temperatures during the winter months. Starting in the late fall, this cactus should be kept between 50-65°F (10-18°C), and away from central heating vents. The cooler spell is demanded over the course of the entire winter, during which time the segments of cactus will turn a light gray color. Failure to provide these controlled winter conditions will result in plant death the following spring.",

The soil should be kept moist, but not soggy. After the first season, more sporadic watering is required. During the winter cycle, the cactus should not be watered at all, with watering to resume in the early spring.",

    "light": "Most books and guides will agree that bright light without direct sunlight should be provided. However, providing some direct sunlight is great for the Bird's nest fern to grow well, but you need to only provide some morning or a small amount of pre-sunset. The fronds can become pale or have scorch marks on them if the sun is too hot. During the winter the sun is much less harmful to the plant.",
    "watering": "This is a species that loves it's soil to remain moist at all times, but not soggy. Water around the edge of the center rosette to avoid the water becoming stagnant in the center, which may cause rot.",
    "soil": "A peat based potting mix is required. 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite (maybe a little less) is one mixture that will be fine. A peat based mixture with organic material is also good.",
    "rePotting": "The Asplenium nidus does not need a pot change very often because it's roots are very small. Once every 2 years is advised for a mature species and once a year while it's young. These do not generally have a problem with becoming root bound, but have more of an issue with staying stable in the pot - this is because the roots are small and they're usually attached to a tree making their own mount. Watch out to see if the plant is becoming unstable and move to a larger pot if it is.",

    "light": "In their natural habitat these ferns will be provided small amounts of sunshine under trees, shaded. The best light conditions to provide is indirect sunlight, although a small amount of sunlight (when it's not too hot) encourages growth. Filtered sunlight through net curtains works well. You may want to rotate the plant to encourage even growth of the fronds.",
    "watering": "Moist soil at all times is advisable, without the soil becoming soggy.",
    "soil": "Peat moss potting soil mixes are best suited with perlite added combined with all-purpose soil. The soil needs to be able to retain some water but also have the ability to drain fairly well. Too much peat moss then water can become clogged and too much perlite with all-purpose will drain too quickly.",
    "rePotting": "Re-potting is done during spring once every 2 years while it's growing fast to a pot size bigger. Still change the top soil each spring even if a pot change is not required.",
    "fertilizer": "A balanced fertilizer diluted given to the plant every 2 weeks should suffice. Feed from April - Sept and don't feed after re-potting and changing the soil for one month (enough nutrients will be available in the new soil).",
    "humidity": "All ferns prefer fairly high humidity levels, however, the Boston fern is slightly more resilient and can tolerate lower levels. If you can....increase levels with a humidifier and not a humidity tray because your likely to keep the plant in a hanging basket or similar, so the plant cannot be placed in a tray.",
    "propagation": "These are propagated either by division or separating runners. The runners are small plantlets that grow from the mother plant that you will have to look out for and remove once they have grown enough to separate from the mother plant and survive independently. Dividing the plant into sections is the most popular propagation method carried out during spring. You can divide the fern into how many new plants you want by cutting though the root system for the section you require."

    "description": "The reason the Adiantum raddianum is most suited for growing in a terrarium or within a conservatory is because it thrives in high humidity conditions that are difficult to provide within most rooms in a house. This delicate species is in need of a consistent supply of moisture, from the atmosphere and it's soil. You'll find these growing near a water feature in some large buildings and thriving due to it being content with the amount of moisture it's getting and shade.There are a number of these ferns grown from the Adiantum genus, with the A.raddianum being one of the most popular grown indoors. All of these (about 200 or more) named Maidenhair fern, have similar characteristics and share most of the same care needs to grow well.",
    "temperature": "The ideal temperature to provide is between 65-75ºF (18-24ºC) for this plant. The minimum is 55ºF (13ºC).",
    "light": "A place with indirect sun is best suited for this fern. If you can provide a fairly shaded place with small amounts of filtered sun then your on to a winner. In their natural woodland habitat they would be shaded by trees, but receive some spots of sun.",
    "watering": "Your fern is best kept well watered and the soil to remain moist at all times. Your likely to have problems if you allow the soil to dry out.",
    "soil": "A peat based potting mix is required which includes organic matter. If you can sit the pot in a larger pot surrounded with peat moss that will also improve the much needed humidity this plant requires.",
    "rePotting": "Once every two years during spring will suffice.",
    "fertilizer": "Feed from April - September with a diluted fertilizer once a month to encourage healthy growth.",
    "humidity": "Improve humidity levels by placing the plant on a humidity tray with pebbles or use a humidifier. As mentioned above placing the pot in a larger pot surrounded with peat moss also works (double potting). You might just need to test the plant out by trying only misting and one other method and see if any faults arise.",
    "propagation": "When re-potting in spring and when the plant is large enough you can divide sections. When dividing remove a section of rhizome with the plant by cutting (using a sharp knife). If you have a mature plant that has produced spores (brown spots) on the underside of the leaves it's possible to harvest these, but they're difficult to propagate."

Over the years we have learnt to grow these within our western homes by imitating the plants natural habitat. We've learned how to grow a group of ferns for some time now and the Rabbit's foot is one that will grow well, (if the correct conditions are provided). Moisture and the right amount of light is the rule of thumb here.",
    "temperature": "Temperatures from 60-75ºF (15-24ºC) is advised. No lower than 55ºF (13ºC).",
    "light": "Provide indirect bright light - avoiding direct sunlight. Direct sunlight will scorch the leaves and turn the rhizomes brown, especially with low humidity levels. A small amount of sun (not midday sun) will not cause too much harm and can encourage plant health, but it's a bit risky with this fern.",
    "watering": "During spring and summer try and keep the soil moist at all times, without leaving the soil soaked. This species only has small roots so it's taking most of it's water and nutrients from the top soil and stroring them within it's rhizomes.",
    "soil": "A well draining potting soil that is peat based will suffice.",
    "rePotting": "Re-pot within spring to a slightly larger pot in width - if the rhizomes and roots need more room. This is a good time to cut away rhizomes to propagate new plants. Don't plant the rhizomes in the soil!",
    "fertilizer": "From the beginning of spring until the end of fall use a diluted liquid feed once every 2 - 3 weeks.",

It's a type of plant known as a living stone because of its stone like appearance.. Found in the coastal Namaqualand in the northwest of South Africa, this beautiful looking succulent reproduces actively while its stunning purple flowers gives it plenty of character.",
    "temperature": "Due to where the Argyroderma testiculare originated from it can comfortably handle temperatures of up to 85°F (30°C), however, it is not frost resistant and will need to be protected from cold weather (Min 50°F - 10°C) .",
    "light": "The Argyroderma testiculare thrives best in areas that are sunny but have partial shade. Some direct sun is great, so if possible, balance is best. Living stones are not happy in complete shade, it does not conform with their natural habitat at all.",
    "watering": "Due to its succulent nature, the plant is drought-tolerant and has average water needs. It is important that it is not over-watered. Watering during winter can almost cease. Overwatering is the worst thing you could do, especially if temperatures are cold. Water when the soil becomes dry to the touch.",
    "soil": "This is a plant that likes a loamy soil and therefore, a cactus potting mix is ideal. Should you want to mix your own soil it will require one part of course sand to two parts soil in order to encourage healthy drainage. Many growers will cover the top soil with gravel or small rocks which is fine to do and encourages drainage.",
    "rePotting": "There will be a requirement to repot the plant every two to three years as it can outgrow the container. Containers do not have to be deep as the plant does have shallow roots. Using clay pots is beneficial because they are porous and remove water quicker, preventing waterlogged soil.",
    "fertilizer": "Fertilizing once a month is advised but once the flowering begins, stop. Begin feeding again once growth appears. A cactus diluted fertilizer is good to use, at about half the strength. It's debatable whether or not these type of plants even require feeding, so you could choose not to feed, but I would advise you to change the soil every two years (the new soil will provide nutrients).",
    "humidity": "Providing the air humidity is average to dry, the plant will grow perfectly well. They're not high humidity lovers unlike many plants.",
    "propagation": "Grown from seed, during the winter sowing will have to be place in vented containers or an unheated greenhouse. Seeds can be sown indoors prior to the last frost and germinated in a damp paper towel. Another option is to separate by division if clumps have formed ."

The species is extremely distinct with its creamy, gray color. A near stemless plant that grows beautiful leaves during summer and autumn. A relatively easy plant to grow due to its ability to handle a wide spectrum of temperatures.",

    "soil": "The Lithop Fulleri prefers a soil that is sandy and gritty and therefore drains well as they can rot if drainage is not sufficient. Cactus potting mix is a good soil.",
    "rePotting": "They can stay in the same pot for many years and they generally grow better when they are in their own smaller individual pots as larger containers can lead to poor flowers. Repot before it is due to be watered for the first time in spring and place in a soil that drains well.",

They can be grown in containers indoors if the correct conditions are provided and vital care instructions are followed (i.e., soil type, watering and light).",
    "temperature": "The Conophytum ficiforme can cope with various temperatures very well and temperature drops. Consistent temperatures of 65°F (18°C)- 75°F (24°C) will of course enable the plant to grow at its best.",
    "light": "A combination of direct sunlight and indirect light is best suited. A couple of hours of early morning sun or late afternoon sun is best rather than midday. During fall and winter, temperate regions get much less daylight length and this is the time light is important (growing period). If they dont get enough light they are likely to grow slower and blooms may struggle to appear, but nothing harmful should happen unless you water them too much. Some growers may use artificial lighting, grow lights.",
    "watering": "During the dormancy period in summer you'll only need to water them slightly once a month - misting is even better. After they have bloomed during fall (Oct - Nov) you may begin to water them once a week, but do check if the top soil has dried out first, and if it's not dry - dont water. The worst you can do for this plant is water it too much....it will kill it. Underwatering is not an issue and easy to notice when the leaves become wrinkly, just add water if they do, they will bounce back.",

Ready made cactus potting mix is also fine to use, but I would still add half part sand and half part grit to the 2 parts cactus potting mix to encourage drainage and air circulation.",
    "rePotting": "Conophytums do not need to be repotted regularly for a size upgrade although changing the potting mix is advised every 2 years to keep the growing medium in good condition. The best time to repot is after the end of the rest period - late July - August. I would use clay pots that enable moisture to evaporate easily from the soil.",
    "fertilizer": "The Conophytum ficiforme is not fertilized throughout the growing season like many indoor plants. This is because damage may be caused to the plant tissue and further cause rot. If you decide to try and provide them some nutrients with a little feed do this only once or twice (one month and then the following month) at the beginning of the winter growing period with a cactus or succulent diluted fertilizer (10/10/10). The fertilizer can be added to a water mister.",
    "humidity": "Natural air humidity found in temperate regions seems to be fine for this Conophytum to grow. Plenty of air circulation is required when humidity is high or the air is dry.",
    "propagation": "Propagation methods includes taking cuttings or sowing seeds. Growing from seeds takes time for the plant to mature but they're not hard to grow from seed. Keeping temperatures consistent at around 21°C is ideal for seed germination. If your plant has a good clump of leaves and stems you can take cuttings and propagate, between Oct - Nov is best."
